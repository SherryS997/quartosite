# Problem 1. Cluster Vertex Deletion

Given a $k$-coloring of a graph $G$, show that we can find a vertex cover which is a $2(1âˆ’\frac{1}{k})$ approximation. 

Hint: use the $k$-coloring on the vertices of $V_{1/2}$.

# Problem 2. Don't Satisfy Too Much!

In the Point Line Cover problem, we are given a set of $n$ points in the plane and an integer $k$, and the goal is to check if there exists a set of $k$ lines on the plane that contain all the input points. 

Show a kernel for this problem with $\mathcal{O}\left(k^2\right)$ points.

# Problem 2.1 Connected Vertex Cover I.

Design a $\mathcal{O}(2^k)$ vertex kernel for Connected Vertex Cover.

Hint: What can you say about high degree vertices? How many can $G$ have?

Follow up hint: What can you say about two vertices that have the same neighbourhood among the high-degree vertices?

# Problem 2.2 Connected Vertex Cover II.

Observe that the kernelization argument that we made for Vertex Cover does not work as-is for connected vertex cover. Recall that the reduction rules were the following:

- R0. If $k \leqslant 0$ and $E$ is non-empty, return a trivial no-instance.

- R1. If $k \geqslant 0$ and $E$ is empty, return a trivial yes-instance.

- R2. If $v$ is a degree zero vertex, return $(G\setminus \{v\},k)$, i.e, delete $v$ from $G$ and keep the budget the same.

- R3. If $v$ is vertex whose degree is _more_ than $k$, return $(G\setminus \{v\},k-1)$, i.e, delete $v$ from $G$ and reduce the budget by one.

Where does it fail? Justify, if possible, with an example.
