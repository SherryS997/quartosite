# Problem 1. Dominating Set

A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a subset of vertices $S$ such that every vertex in $G$ either belongs to $S$ or has a neighbor in $S$.

Suppose you have an instance of dominating set given by $(G,k)$, which is a YES-instance if and only if $G$ has a dominating set of size at most $k$.

Is the following reduction rule safe?

RR. If $d(v) > k$, then return $(G-v,k-1)$.

Briefly justify your answer.

# Problem 2. Connected Vertex Cover

A connected vertex cover of a graph $G$ is a subset of vertices $S$ such that: (a) $S$ is a vertex cover of $G$, and (b) $G[S]$ is a connected subgraph of $G$.

Suppose you have an instance of connected vertex cover given by $(G,k)$, which is a YES-instance if and only if $G$ has a connected vertex cover of size at most $k$.
