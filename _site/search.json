    "text": "Overview\n\nMy research interests: an elevator pitch1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords: algorithms and complexity • graphs • computational social choice • combinatorial games • constraint satisfaction\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMy broad research interest lies in theoretical aspects of computer science. I am specifically interested in understanding the potential and the limitations of computational power. To this end, we use abstractions that model what computers do, as opposed to, say, analyzing a specific configuration or engineering faster hardware. While this approach does not directly advance state of the art computing tech, it does help with understanding what we can and cannot do with the increasing amounts of computing power at our disposal in a tech-agnostic fashion. This means that most lessons will remain relevant even after you’ve upgraded your systems to use the next generation of hardware, and after that too.\nMost of my work concerns the design and analysis of algorithms for computational problems. The problems I work with are usually inspired from applications that someone cares about, for example:\n\nFinding patterns in large networks (e.g, discovering closely-knit communities in friendship networks).\nDetermining who should win an election given a set of votes.\nDistributing resources among people (who may value them differently) in a way that makes everyone happy.\nComing up with strategies to win a game of solo chess.\nFiguring out how to contain the spread of a fire by deploying as few firefighters as possible.\n\nFor some of these scenarios, it may not be immediately obvious what the computational problem is. For example, consider the issue of who must win an election: you would like to create a reasonable mechanism to build a consensus from a set of votes. What would be considered reasonable?\nWell, you could list out some natural properties that you would want your mechanism to satisfy (for instance, if all voters have the same favorite candidate, it would be very unreasonable for the mechanism to not pick such a candidate as a winner). And then you could seek out a mechanism that satisfies all of these properties. This is the so-called axiomatic approach to voting, and the approach has even led to the discovery of some fascinating impossibility results, indicating that some combinations of properties cannot be achieved by any mechanism, no matter how clever. Now, among other aspects, one would hope that mechanisms we come up with can be efficiently implemented. It turns out that many mechanisms that have a lot of appealing properties are complex to implement, and some of my work involves finding ways of making them more accessible.\nWhile some computational problems admit elegant solutions that have fast implementations in the real world, for several others we have substantial theoretical evidence suggesting that such solutions are going to be elusive. This means that for all practical purposes we have to work our way through trade-offs.\n\n\n\nFig. Exploring tradeoffs between the demands of accuracy, speed, and coverage.\n\n\nWhen we think about designing algorithms, we are usually very demanding in how we go about it: we require our algorithms to be fast and accurate on all conceivable inputs. This is asking for quite a bit, and perhaps it is not surprising that we cannot afford this luxury all the time. The good news is that most of the time we can make meaningful progress by relaxing just one of these demands:\n\nGive up on accuracy, but not completely: look for solutions that are good enough (approximation) and/or work with algorithms that report the right solution most of the time (Las-Vegas style randomization).\nGive up on coverage, a little bit: let your algorithms work well on structured inputs. Hopefully the structure is such that it is not too limiting and is interesting enough for some application scenario, and is also enough to give you algorithmic leverage, i.e, there’s enough that you can exploit to make fast and accurate algorithms.\nGive up on speed, to some extent: going beyond the traditional allowance of polynomial time, which is the holy grail of what is considered efficient, takes you places. You could either allow for your algorithms have super-polynomial running times, and optimize as much as possible while being accurate on all inputs (exact algorithms), or allow for bad running times on a bounded subset of instances (Monte-Carlo style randomization).\n\nOne approach that tackles all of these tradeoffs at once is to take what is now called a “multivariate approach” to the analysis of running times, which essentially involves appreciating that to describe a problem instance just in terms of its size is like describing a movie by a rating, which is unfortunate because there’s so much more nuance. And yet we report — and think about — worst-case running times in only terms of the sizes of the instances. Consider, for example, how much more informative it is to think of the running time of BFS as O(n+m) rather than O(n^2), also a valid upper bound2. Notice how the latter fails to convey the fact that the running time of BFS is as good as linear on sparse graphs.\nSo the parameterized approach takes into account problem structure by addressing “secondary” measurements (parameters), apart from the primary measurement of overall input size, that significantly affect problem computational complexity. The central notion of fixed parameter tractability (FPT) is a generalization of polynomial-time based on confining any non-polynomial complexity costs to a function only of these secondary measurements. For instance, if you have an algorithm for vertex cover whose running time is O(2^{\\Delta(G)}) \\cdot n^{O(1)}, where \\Delta(G) is the maximum degree of the input graph3, then notice that you would have solved vertex cover in polynomial time on all graphs whose maximum degree is, say, O(\\log n). Sadly, since we know vertex cover to be NP-complete even when restricted to cubic graphs, this specific goal is a bit of a pipedream, but hopefully you see the potential4 in the process.\nTo illustrate how useful this approach can be, consider the typechecking problem for ML, a programming language for which relatively efficient compilers exist. One of the problems the compiler must solve is the checking of the compatibility of type declarations. This problem is known to be EXP-complete (Henglein and Mairson 1994): let’s just say intractable in the classical world. However, the implementations work well in practice because the ML Type Checking problem admits an algorithm (Lichtenstein and Pnueli 1985) with a running time of O(2^kn), where n is the size of the program and k is the maximum nesting depth of the type declarations. Since normally k is a small constant5, the algorithm is clearly practical on inputs one would expect to encounter in practice.\nBack to why this approach captures algorithmic tradeoffs in the regime of hard problems beautifully. You can think of an algorithm that is FPT in some parameter k as giving you efficient algorithms for that subclass of instances where k is small enough for the algorithm to be efficient. You could also think of it as giving you full coverage but giving up on efficiency as your parameter values loom larger. Finally, you can also devise randomized and/or approximate FPT algorithms, to have the FPT efficiency gains while giving up on accuracy, which may be necessary either for speedups or when working with problems that would not have FPT algorithms otherwise (like we just saw for vertex cover parameterized by maximum degree).\nParameterized (aka multivariate) algorithmics are a wonderfully flexible framework that allows you to dabble in various algorithmic tradeoffs. Once you start thinking in terms of restraining the combinatorial blowups to certain parameters of interest, you’ll probably find that the approach leads you to new ways of looking at the problem! To stay true to the motivations of the field: which is to find ways of “coping with NP-hardness” when said NP-hard problems are ones we need to solve in the real world — one must remember to sanity checck the relevance of the parameters we are working with. An ideal set of parameters would be small for most instances in real-world distributions, but also give you enough flex to devise efficient algorithms.\nFor a delightful history of the field, I recommend (Bodlaender et al. 2012). Also, (Cygan et al. 2015) is a very accessible introduction to the field, only assuming a background in undergraduate algorithms. The FPT Wiki is a community-maintained resource that documents developments in the field as they happen.\nThis framework has been my default way of thinking about algorithms for a while now. In the following, I delve a little further into the specifics of the kinds of problems I have been working on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\nGames on graphs ⸱ Voting ⸱ Fair Division ⸱ Combinatorial Games ⸱ Backdoors to SAT ⸱ Eliminating Forbidden Subgraphs\n\n\nIncidentally, I am also interested in issues of CS education, mostly from the perspective of a poorly performing practitioner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBodlaender, Hans L., Rod Downey, Fedor V.

It’s important to do this nicely based on what you want to do with the information.\nFor example, the notes you might be taking in this class is information. If you have no plans of revisiting them later, you can take them as you please, or better yet, not take them at all!\nHowever, you want your notes optimised for giving you quality company during a 2AM revision session on exam day, competing with Maggi for attention, you want your notes to be competently taken: they don’t have to be neat, and it’s enough for them to be useful.\nOn the other hand, if you are taking notes so that a special someone who will inevitably miss a few classes will almost certainly ask for later, then you would be making notes to impress, and that potentially requires a different approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout this course, we will try to make sense of trade-offs.\n\n\n\nWe’ll equip ourselves with ideas that will ultimately help you decide questions like: how do you organise the clothes in your cupboard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrow ’em in, nobody’s looking\nKeep it where you can find it later\n\n\n\n\nTime to process\nNegligible\nForever\n\n\nTime to retrieve\nForever\nNegligible\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The first episode happens to be all about solving quadratics:\n\n\n\nA screenshot from #LockdownMath showing Grant Sanderson solving quadratics.\n\n\nNow, it’s quite natural to want to “write a program”, so to speak, that can take a quadratic equation such as x^2 - 7x + 12 as input and output its two roots.\nGiven that programs running on your phone are able to make suggestions, even if dubious, for what series to binge-watch next on Netflix, finding roots of quadratics should be a fairly benign exercise.\nYou might recall that most programs let you declare variables that can hold on to specific types of information, for instance: numbers, strings, and so forth. Our input doesn’t “look” like a number, so it would be a fair take to simply store it as a string:\npx = \"x^2 - 7x + 12\";\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is a perfectly faithful representation, you can imagine that it would be slightly painful to work with. You would have to write some code that can “pull out” the parts of the string that represent the numbers you care about (in this example, b = -7 and c = 12), so that you can move on to your calculation, which is an expression involving numbers.\nGiven that a quadratic with the leading coefficient normalized to one is uniquely determined by two numbers, it seems a lot simpler to directly represent the polynomial as two integers instead:\npx_b = -7\npx_c = 12\nYou might appreciate that this saves us quite some circus and we can quite directly get to the computation we’re interested in. What if you cared about higher order polynomials? You may want to solve them (even if you run out of expressions for solutions pretty quickly, you might be interested in other ways of getting to the roots), or manipulate them in other ways (for example, by adding or multiplying them).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood for thought.\n\n\n\nHow would you represent higher-order polynomials? What about multivariate polynomials? Is there a way that you might be able to capture an algebraic expression for a polynomial without either using strings or just the coefficients?"

Let’s recollect the setup:\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration from an implementation by Nicky Case.\n\n\nSuppose you want to implement your own version of this game, where the program responds to inputs from the user and plays according to a specific, pre-meditated strategy. Remember you have seen some strategies already:\n\n\n\n\n\nA second illustration from the same implementation by Nicky Case.\n\n\nWe reproduce these strategies below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Strategies\n\n\n\n\nCOPYCAT: Hello! I start with Cooperate, and afterwards, I just copy whatever you did in the last round. Meow.\nALWAYS CHEAT: The strong shall eat the weak.\nALWAYS COOPERATE: Let’s be best friends <3\nGRUDGER: Listen, pardner. I’ll start cooperatin’, and keep cooperatin’, but if y’all ever cheat me, I’LL CHEAT YOU BACK TIL THE END OF TARNATION.\nDETECTIVE: First: I analyze you. start: Cooperate, Cheat, Cooperate, Cooperate. If you cheat back, I’ll act like Copycat. If you never cheat back, I’ll act like Always Cheat, to exploit you. Elementary, my dear Watson.\n\n\n\nLet’s say that your program is designed to play 5 rounds and that your program is playing the copycat strategy. To begin with, you might want to declare a couple of variables to keep track of the scores of the players, and ten variables to track the moves of both players in each round. With this, your code may start out looking like this:\nmy_points = 0\nuser_points = 0\n\nuser_move_1 = input(\"Input 1 for Cooperate and 0 for Cheat.\")\n\n//Sanity check input:\nif(user_move_1 != 1 and user_move_1 != 0):\n    express disappointment and abort\n// My first move is to cooperate:\nmy_points += -1\nuser_points += 3\n\nif(user_move_1):\n    my_points += 3\n    user_points -= 1\nNow your next move is determined by the value of user_move_1, so you might proceed as follows.\nuser_move_2 = input(\"Input 1 for Cooperate and 0 for Cheat.\")\n\n//Sanity check input:\nif(user_move_2 != 1 and user_move_2 != 0):\n    express disappointment and abort\n// My next move is based on the user's first:\nif(user_move_1):\n    my_points += -1\n    user_points += 3\n\nif(user_move_2):\n    my_points += 3\n    user_points -= 1\n…and so on and on, you get the drift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood for thought.\n\n\n\nDo you really need ten variables to track the game? If you were instead implementing the always cheat or always cooperate strategy, how many variables would you need? What about the strategies of the grudger and the detective?\n\n\nNow, suppose we come up with our own player, whom we call the majority mover. This player looks at your entire game history, and cooperates if you have cooperated more than you have cheated, and cheats if you have cheated more than you have cooperated, and acts randomly otherwise.\nIt seems like implementing the majority mover strategy would really require keeping track of everything. Or would it? You might observe at this point that it’s enough to keep track of two counts: the number of rounds and the number of moves where the user has cheated: note that it does not matter when the cheats happened in the history of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also…\n\n\n\n\n\n…track the number of cooperate moves along with the number of rounds; or the number of cheat moves and the number of cooperate moves.\nAt this point it’s a matter of taste :)\n\n\n\nHow about a completely random player? This one chooses a number K between 1 and N uniformly at random (let’s not worry about how this is done for now, because that would be a story for another day), where N is the number of rounds played so far; and mimics the other player’s Kth move. To implement this strategy, you really would need to keep track of the user’s entire game history with the five variables, and also assume that you have a way of picking a number at random.\nFinally, consider that instead of fixing your program to play five rounds — 🥱 — you want to politely ask the user how many rounds they want to play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, for the first few players, this is just a matter of upgrading your for loop (which you should have switched to already when you realised that you don’t need all. those. variables.) to use N: and you are done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood for thought.\n\n\n\nHow will you implement this version if you are working with our latest player? If you happen to have a very enthusiastic user who asks for half a million rounds, would you be able to declare that many variables all at once, while your program is running? Notably, you don’t know what the user is going to say ahead of time!"

    "text": "Representing a subset of a deck of cards\nIf you are implementing a card1 game, you might need a mechanism for keeping track of “hands”, or various subsets of cards. Let’s say a hand is a subset of cards. For many games, you would need the ability to be able to quickly:\n\ntell if a particular card belongs to a hand or not,\nadd a card to a hand,\nremove a card from a hand, and\nreplace a card in a hand with another one.\n\nOne way to meet these requirements is to declare a collection of 52 boolean (i.e, true/false or 0/1) variables to represent the hand: the cards in the hand are set to true while cards that don’t belong are set to false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood for thought.\n\n\n\nWhat do you like about this method? What don’t you like about it?\n\n\nHere’a another way, though: you could agree on a notation for the cards in the deck: e.g, a standard one is to use a number, A/J/Q/K to denote the value, and S/C/D/H to denote the suit, so every card can be represented as a pair of characters. For example the Ace of Diamonds would be AD, the five of spades would be 5S and the King of Hearts would be KH. With this in place, you could represent a hand also by simply concatenating these string representations of the cards in the hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood for thought.\n\n\n\nWhat do you like about this method? What don’t you like about it?\n\n\nNow for this toy example, if you were to implement both methods and clock the time taken to implement the four operations above, you may not notice a major difference. However, for actual applications, you may be in a situation where your subsets (here, the “hands”) may be coming from a large universe (here, the “deck”). On the other hand, you may have a very large number of operations to take care of efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood for thought.\n\n\n\nAre there other ways that you might want to store this kind of information, given the things you want to do are as enlisted above?\n\n\nYour choice of method will again be driven by the requirements: the one thing to keep in mind is that you cannot have it all, but we can usually get pretty damn close!"

Also notice that the complexity of search is proportional to the length of the longest root-to-leaf path in the tree5 in the worst case.5 Since it’s going to be awkward to keep talking about the “length of the longest root-to-leaf path in the tree”, we will simply refer to this as the height of the tree.\nTo insert(x), first search(x): if x is found, there’s nothing to do; if x is not found, then make note of the leaf where the search stopped — say \\ell: then if x is greater than k_\\ell, introduce a right child of \\ell and assign to it the key value x; on the other hand if x is less than k_\\ell, introduce a left child of \\ell and assign to it the key value x. Notice the tree with the newly added node is still a valid binary search tree.\nWhat about delete(x)? If x is not in the collection, there’s nothing to do. If x does belong to the collection and is associated with a leaf node, then the node can simply be knocked out, no further action required. However, what if the node whose key value is x — say v — is an serious one, with a left and a right child? One possibility is to swap x with an appropriate value ascribed to some leaf node, and then knock out the leaf: which now carries the value of x. Which leaf should we swap with? It’s clear that it can’t be just any leaf: but you could pick the smallest value in the right subtree or the largest value in the left subtree — both of these reside and leaves, and the swaps with them would leave you with a valid BST after the deed is done.\nTo find the smallest value in the right subtree, you can take the right turn from v and then go left until you are stuck. If you prefer the largest value in left subtree instead, take the left turn from v and go right until you are stuck. Either of these should work fine. You can find some examples of deletions in a BST here.\nNotice that the complexity of all three operations are proportional to the height of the tree: so if we can control the height, we control the complexity of these operations! Notice also that the height of a BST — if built by implementing the algorithms above — can be as bad as linear in the number of keys6, which is no good. Play around with this visualization of BSTs to get a feel!6 Try, for example, inserting 1,2,3,\\ldots,n in that order."

    "text": "(2,3) Trees\nOne way of controlling the height of a BST is to simply demand it: this is called solving a problem by definition :) What if we could insist on having BSTs where the underlying tree structure must have the following additional property:\n\n\nall nodes have either 0 or two children\nall leaves are at the same distance from the root.\n\n\nThis would automatically force the structure of the underlying tree to be complete i.e, if the tree has height h, any node whose distance from the root is less than h must be a branching node (indeed, if not, then it is a leaf by property (1), but then we will have a violation of property (2)). Why is this great? Because if you have n nodes packed into a complete tree of height h, then the height must, in fact, be O(\\log n) — which is what we wanted.\nThere is, however, a small catch with this: such trees may not exist for some values of n, the total number of keys that we are trying to accommodate :( We can fix this in two ways: add some dummy keys with values that either duplicate existing values till we have a feasible number of keys to work with (ugh), or make room for multi-ary search trees (cool!).\nSince we want the elegant approach, let’s push our definition further:\n\n\nall nodes have either 0, two, or three children\nnodes that have two children store one key value and satisfy the standard BST property\nnodes with three children store two key values, say a and b; and further:\n\n\nthe subtree rooted at the left-most child only hosts values smaller than a\nthe subtree rooted at the right-most child only hosts values larger than b\nthe subtree rooted at the middle child only hosts values strictly between a and b\n\n\nall leaves are at the same distance from the root.\n\n\nAdapting search(x) to multi-ary trees is extremely natural.\nIf the tree is rooted at r and r is a node with two children, proceed as before.\nOtherwise, suppose r hosts the values a_r and b_r. Then check if x equals either a_r or b_r: if yes, then we’ve found what we are looking for, so abort and celebrate; on the other hand, if not, then repeat the following until you’ve either found x or have run out of elements in the tree:\n\nif x is greater than b_r, continue searching in the 🌳 rooted at the right-most child of r\nif x is smaller than a_r, continue searching in the 🌳 rooted at the left-mostt child of r\notherwise, continue searching in the 🌳 rooted at the middle child of r\n\nWhat about insert(x)? We search for x as before. If found, there’s nothing to be done. If not, there are two scenarios:\n\nThe search terminates at a leaf that has one key value.\nThe search terminates at a leaf that has two key values.\n\n Note that unlike before, we cannot just have the leaf sprout a child to accommodate the new key value (remember that all leaves have to be at the same distance from the root). So our algorithm pushes upwards, and works as follows:\n\nIf there’s room in the current node (i.e, the node is one with two children or a leaf with one key value), accommodate the new value into that node, reorganizing as necessary. In particular, when a node with two children + one value transforms into one with three children + two values, then the subtrees have to be appropriately reorganized.\nIf there’s no room in the current node, then move up to the parent. If there’s no parent: then you’ve hit the root! If the root turns out to be crowded too, then you’ll have to split the root (note that this causes the height of the tree to increase, but does not happen too often), but if the root has room then follow the procedure in the previous step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice!\n\n\n\nWork through some examples in this (2,3)-tree visualizer and go through the questions here to validate your understanding of the structure of (2,3)-trees."

    "text": "Link to slides\nLink to a Tweet thread summarizing these notes\nBefore we talk about exploring graphs, we will take a small detour to throw in some motivation. In our discussion here we will establish that knowing how to go around a graph can meaningfully help us pull off a spectacular card trick. I trust that this should leave us sufficiently interested in finding out how we can actually find those Euler tours, which is our next stop.\n\n\n\nA deck with 32 cards is given to someone in the audience.\nAny number of cut shuffles1 are done.\nOnce the audience is satisfied that the deck is suitably shuffled, it is passed to someone, say P, from where the following happens:\nP takes the top card and passes the deck to the next person (Q).\nQ takes the top card and passes the deck to the next person (R).\nR takes the top card and passes the deck to the next person (S).\nS takes the top card and passes the deck to the next person (T).\nAll five people look at their cards without revealing them to anyone else.\nThose who got red cards are requested to stand up.\nAll cards are identified.\n\n1 A cut shuffle involves taking some number of cards from the top of the deck, placing them on the table, and then placing the rest of the deck on top of them. So if the stack has cards 1,2,3,4,5 from bottom to top, then it will look like 4,5,1,2,3 after a cut shuffle with two cards shaved off the top.\n\n\nInterpreting reds as 1’s and blacks as 0’s, any sequence of five cards is a signal: a bitstring of length 5. This is — at least in principle — enough to ID one of the cards in a 32-card deck, for sure. But to ID the next five cards too? Wow!\nSo to begin with, let’s just focus on ID-ing card. The deck, of course, is setup: the cards appear in a specific order, one whose relevant properties are unperturbed by cut shuffles. Note that we have no control over how many times the deck is cut, so the top card could be effectively anywhere in from the original sequence. So what we need is a sequence of 32 bits:\nb_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_i, \\ldots, b_{31}\nwith the following property. For any i \\in \\{0,\\ldots,31\\}, if B_i denotes2 the substring:2 subscripts are mod 32\nb_{i}, b_{i+1}, b_{i+2}, b_{i+3}, b_{i+4},\nthen we would very much like that b_i \\neq b_j whenever i \\neq j. This ensures that no matter how many times the deck is cut, when the members of the audience with the red cards stand up, we have a clean and unambiguous signal, which we can pre-relate by our powers of rote memory to the card at position i in said sequence. Because subscripts are read mod 32, note that this is really all we need. For example, here’s a seuquence that does happen to have the property we are after:\n\n00000100101100111110001101110101\n\nThe diagram below shows why cut shuffles still result in sequences where the signal from any location continues to be unique, and in some sense, invariant across shuffles: suppose a position x corresponds to a certain signal S_x before a cut shuffle, then after a cut shuffle, if position x shifts to y, then S_y = S_x. Note that this would not be true if someone, say, enthusiastically riffle shuffled the pack — so do make sure to prevent this at all cost.\n\n\n\nExamples of cut shuffles and why they don’t affect the addressing technique. The first column shows the original sequence, the second shows the proposed cut, and the last shows the final sequence after the cut shuffle is excecuted.\n\n\nThis property makes the sequence a robust device for card discovery: we simply associate a specific card with every 5-length bit string, and position the card corresponding to b_i at location i. By knowing the signature corresponding to the top five cards after any number of cut shuffles, you know where this signal appeared in the original sequence, and by turdging further along in the sequence, you also know the signals for the next five cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou perhaps see now how you can perform the entire trick:\n\n\n\n\nmemorize the sequence 00000100101100111110001101110101\nassociate† a card with each bit-string of length 5\nmemorize said association\nplace cards as dictated by the sequence and given by the association\nprofit and/or impress\n\n† Note that the association has to respect the semantics of the bitstring: so the 1-positions get red cards and the 0-positions get black (or the other way round if you please, so long as you are consistent in your conventions throughout).\n\n\nNotice that once you can read off one card, having committed the seuqence and the association to memory, you can also read off any of the cards after that. This does seem like a lot of memorizing, but it’s worth it for the impact.\n\n\n\nIf you want to make your life easier, you could use an association that is easy to remember:\n\n\n\nA useful dictionary between 5-bit strings and cards from a standard deck of cards\n\n\nSo getting to the first card is quite straightforward already:\n\nIf the first person is seated, they have a black card, and otherwise they have a red card. But this is immediate anyway from the convention, so not particularly impressive to point out.\n\nWhen the card is black: if the second person is seated, it is a ♣, otherwise a ♠.\nWhen the card is red: if the second person is seated, it is a ⬥, otherwise a ♥.\n\nFinally, the value of the card is just translating the last three bits to their value in decimal (remembering to map all zeroes to eight).\n\nIf you want to really impress with the next four, you could just memorize the whole sequence, but to avoid visible murmuring, you can also exploit a handy feature of this particular sequence that helps you navigate it with only a little bit of mental math.\nIt turns out that if you know b_i (which you do based on who stands up), you can obtain the next bit (i.e, the sixth bit relative to the start of b_i) in the sequence by simply adding the first and third bits from b_i. In other words, the sequence has the following nice pattern: standing anywhere, you can obtain the next bit by taking the sum (mod 2) of the bits that are three and five bits behind wherever you are standing. Go on, verify this for yourself!33 If you do, you’ll find this is not quite true at the fourth and fifth positions. The claimactually works if you drop any one of the leading 0’s, e.g. the first one. This gives you a sequence of 31 cards to work with which have this nice pattern. If you want to be a purist, though, you can commit this exception to memory.\n\n\n\nSo how does this lovely self-working card-trick fit, even if as a detour, into our discussion about graphs?\nLet’s step back for a bit. We pulled out the driver of this whole setup, the sequence:\n\n00000100101100111110001101110101\n\nmuch like a real magician pulls out a real rabbit from a real hat. You very likely raised an eyebrow and wondered about where this sequence came from. It’s a useful exercise to experiment with coming up with one, even if by means of ad-hoc scribbling. As a warmup, it’s worth trying to find one of length eight, where every 3-bit string occurs exactly once4.4 Apparently the Sanskrit sutra yamätärajabhänasalagam (and variants thereof), which describes all possible triplets of short and long syllables, is considered evidence that such sequences were known in India from a while ago. Sanskrit meters are based on the system of short (laghu) and long (guru) syllables, and you might count this as a hint for the exercise here. If you are curious about the history of the sutra, look no further than this article.\nIt turns out that such sequences are in fact rather well-studied, and one way of generating them involves taking a walk in an appropriate graph! In particular, let us go back to our original task of generating a 32-bit sequence like the one shown above, except that we are on our own this time. Consider a graph where we have:\n\na vertex for every bit string of length four, and let us say that the bit string associated with a vertex u is denoted by b_u; and\nan edge from u to v if the corresponding bit strings are all but the same: i.e, the 3-length suffix of u is the same as the 3-length prefix of v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to take a look at the graph, it’s right here…\n\n\n\n\n\n…although a bit of a monstrosity!\n\n\n\nThe de Bruijn graph of order 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following properties are worth thinking about:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe total number of vertices is _____\n\n\n\n\n\nOne for every bit string of length four, so sixteen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevery vertex has indegree and outdegree _____\n\n\n\n\n\nFix a vertex v and let s_v denote the last three bits of v. The only outgoing edges are to vertices that represent the bit strings s_v0 and s_v1.\nFix a vertex v and let p_v denote the first three bits of v. The only incoming edges are from vertices that represent the bit strings 0p_v and 1p_v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe total number of edges is _____\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are sixteen vertices and each of them has outdegree two, so the total number of edges is 32. Does that ring a bell yet?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthere are exactly _____ self-loops\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a vertex v. Let the bit string associated with v be denoted by WXYZ. For v to be adjacent to itself, we will need XYZ = WXY, which implies that W = X, X = Y, Y = Z.\nSo if W = 1, then we have that WXYZ = 1111 and if W = 0 then we have WXYZ = 0000.\nThese are the only two possible scenarios, so our graph has exactly two self-loops.\n\n\n\nIf you were to take an Euler tour in this graph, i.e, walk around visiting every edge exactly once, then it very naturally spells out a sequence as follows. Start with an empty string. Now as you move around, going from the vertex u to v along the edge (u,v) amounts to essentially “seeing one new bit”: recall that the suffix of u almost fully eats up the prefix of v, leaving one new bit to observe, which is what we tag on to our sequence. Once you have traveled along every edge exactly once, you’ve collected exactly 32 bits, so we have written out a sequence of length 32 by the time we are done5.5 If edges were 1km roads, we would have been just 10km shy of a full marathon.\nNow: our somewhat outrageous claim is that this infact is a valid de Bruijn sequence! Given that we have written out exactly 32 bits, it is enough to show that any bit sequence of length 5 shows up as a substring in this sequence starting from some position. The main intuition here is the following: suppose you want to “see” the bitstring PQRST in your sequence. Well, at some point in our walk on the graph, we moved from the vertex representing PQRS to the one representing QRST6. This made us add T to whatever sequence we had so far. Let’s rewind our walk a bit and see what happened in the last few steps too:6 Indeed, this must have happened at some point, since we visit every edge exactly once.\nLMNO → MNOP → NOPQ → OPQR → PQRS → QRST\nRetracing our steps, here are the bits that would have been triggered by this walk: PQRST, and thus we are almost done. You might say: perhaps the edge from the vertex representing PQRS to the one representing QRST was taken very early on, at the start of the tour, so we don’t have these many steps to retrace: but here’s the thing — we are on a tour, so you can continue walking back past your starting point and the sequence would still have this overall form: it’s just that a few of those bits would be written at the end, rather than at the start, and that just means that we can find our substring wrapped around the end, which is a perfectly valid place to discover it.\nNotice that there was nothing special about this whole process and the numbers four and five: you can generate so-called “de Bruijn sequences of order k”, which are bitstrings of length 2^k with the property that every k-bit string appears exactly once in the sequence as a substring (including wraparoudns), using exactly the same idea.\nSo you should be convinced by now — perhaps after reflecting for a moment or two — that de Bruijn sequences of any order in fact exist, which is not obvious at all from the definition. It turns out that there are actually quite a few of them: 2^{2^{k-1}-k}, to be precise, a formula we know thanks to de Bruijn, after whom the sequences are named.\nYou might wonder if there are other ways of coming up with these sequences, or possibly even enumerating them. These discussions are unfortunately out of scope, but there are several excellent resources for the curious. Much of these notes are based on the third chapter of the book Magical Mathematics: The Mathematical Ideas That Animate Great Magic Tricks which is a treasure of a book. Paraphrasing from this chapter, here is a little about the people behind this trick:\n\nThe origins of this trick go back to Charles T. Jordan in 1919, and the original version required a color pattern of length 6 to identify all the cards. Later William Larson and T. Page Wright came up with another variant involving 52 cards, and 3 people revealing the suits being enough for the magician to pick up the values. In the 1960s, Karl Fulves and, separately, P. Diaconis working with the chemist Ronald Wohl, derived dozens of tricks based on variations and extensions of Jordan’s idea."

    "text": "Link to Slides\nSo far, we have worked with atomic types, which is to say variables that can hold a “single kind of data” for us — like integers, characters, strings, booleans, and so on. Often, however, we need to work with compound types, which is to say, a bunch of these things taken together. For example, you may have sensed that when we spoke of maintaining a set of cards earlier with 52 booleans, it may have been nicer if they could be strung together into a single, unified structure: for one, it saves you having to keep track of a large number of variables, and further, it might be easier — as we will find out — to manipulate the data in response to operations that we may want to support.\nWhen you speak of a bunch of objects, it is useful to agree on whether you interpret the collection as an ordered or unordered set. Consider the following examples:\n\nYour playlist of happy songs\nA stack of cards\nPeople living in a house\nTeams that played in the Asia Cup 2022\nChess pieces on a board mid-game\n\nWhile some people play their happy songs in shuffle mode, for some the playlist is carefully organized, and the order matters. A stack of cards and chess pieces on a board are clearly collections with a natural sense of order, and one that is very likely to be important. On the other hand, people who live in a particular house or the set of teams that participated in the Asia cup in 2022 can be thought of as sets with no underlying order: of course, if you had to impose one you could cook something up1 (e.g, alphabetical, favorites, and so on). We will focus on storing ordered lists for now and return to sets in due course.1 For example, the C++ implementation of set maintains a default order even though it is, by nomenclature, modeling unordered sets. On the other hand, the unordered_set data structure in the C++ STL throws all caution to the wind and buys faster operations on average.\nThere are a few different ways that you can store a list of things in a computer’s memory. Imagine that you are real estate agent and you want to book some houses in a complex for your current and future clients. Stretching your imagination a little bit further, say all houses are numbered from 1 to 1000 and are positioned on a straight line in the natural order (i.e, 2 after 1, 3 after 2, and so on). Some houses are occupied and others are not. If you reserve k houses, management will find some contiguous block of k unoccupied houses and give you the number of the first house in the block. For instance, if you ask for 50 houses, you would get a letter from the management saying 50 houses starting from #420 are yours. If you need 20 more houses later, you would get a letter from the management saying 70 houses starting from #777 are yours. That’s right: they are not obiligied to give you houses #470 to #489, indeed, these may not be avaiailable. They could just give you an additional chunk of 20 houses somewhere else, but sadly that’s not how they roll: them management, them rules. There are also no refunds: you can’t give back reserved houses.\nNow here comes our first dilemma: how many houses do we reserve? Say we have 20 clients: it is clear that we need to reserve at least 20 houses, but should we reserve a few more? Reservations are not free, so we don’t want to reserve a very large number of houses either: remember, there are no refunds. But on the other hand, if we reserve too few, and we end up with more clients than the number of houses we’ve reserved, we will be in a sticky situation — worst case some clients may have to move, which is not ideal. You will have to work on coming up with a reasonable estimate of how many clients you will eventually have, and hope for the best.\n\n\n\nExpanding your reservations can get tricky\n\n\nOver time you find that this business of estimating the number of clients you have is an unpleasant one: both under and overestimates lead to losses, which makes you wonder if there are apartments that have more flexible options. You look around, and why yes, you find a different apartment complex — again a thousand houses on a line neatly numbered 1 to 1000 from left to right, but this time, management reserves one house at a time. You want a new house, you simply ask for one. But there’s a catch: the paperwork here requires you to submit the client’s information, and they directly get their house number. So this is actually quite efficient: the management does all the work and you can reserve exactly what you need. All is well until it’s time for Diwali and you realize you don’t know where your clients are housed, and you can’t send them postcards, sweets, and advertisements.\nYou could, of course, just call your clients and ask them for their house numbers, but then this requires you to maintain some kind of register, and let us just say that you are not good with that kind of thing. So here’s what you do instead: you only keep the first client’s address, because that’s just one thing that’s easy to remember. Then you ask your i-th client to remember the address of the (i+1)-th client: they are slightly bewildered but you tell them it’s for insurance. Now if you want to pay a visit to your \\ell-th client, you just start from your first one, and follow the trail. Peculiar, but works.\n\n\n\nWalking around to find your clients with new management.\n\n\nNote that with the previous maangement this was never a problem: you had a contiguous block of houses that you allocated sequentially, so your i-th client’s house address was always at hand if you were good with arithmetic or had a calculator: simply add (i-1) to the house number of the first client.\nAs analogies go this was both unrealistic and imprefect, but I hope it gives you a sense of the main trade-offs involved in the two ways we have to store sequential data — very roughly speaking:\n\nin contiguous blocks, access is easy, flexibility is hard;\nwith elements all over the place, access is indirect but the structure is relatively flexible.\n\n\n\nQuoting Wikipedia:\n\nAn array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.\n\n\nFor example, an array of 10 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, …, 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, …, 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i × 4).[4]\n\n\n\n\nQuoting Wikipedia:\n\nA linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.\n\n\nMore complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists.\n\n\n\n\nGiven a fully occupied array with n elements v/s a linked list with n elements, here are the costs of some operations that you might want to perform:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations\nArrays\nSingly Linked List\n\n\n\n\nLooking up the i-th element\ninstant\n\\approx i\n\n\nAdding a new element at the start\n\\approx n\ninstant\n\n\nAdding a new element at the end\n\\approx n\n\\approx n\n\n\nRemoving the i-th element\n\\approx n-i\n\\approx i\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correct answer is: it depends. If you expect your lists to be heavily manipulated, then linked lists are likely to be the better choice. On the other hand, if yuo are working with a list of a predictable size (or you at least have a known and reasonable upper bound on the size), and direct access is important to you, then arrays are the way to go. If you are dissatisfied with both methods, then consider transforming your unhappiness into motivation for discovering more sophisticated options!"

    "text": "Abstractions via Graphs\nIt’s useful to model such problems using graphs (aka networks). And we’re not talking sine curves here — a graph in our context is a structure that represents relationships between entities.\nUsually these relationships are between two entities at a time. Indeed, this is typically already quite a bit to keep track of, hence graphs that do more are said to be hyper. That is to say, graphs that model relationships involving more than two entities in one go are generally called hypergraphs, and they will be a story for another day.\nFor now, we will variously refer to entities as vertices or nodes, and relationships as edges or connections. Come to think of it, graphs are everywhere:\n\n\n\nEntities\nTwo entitites are in a relationship if…\n\n\n\n\nPeople\nthey are in a relationship.\n\n\nCats\nthey have fought each other.\n\n\nActors\nthey have been in a movie together.\n\n\nAirports\nthere is a direct flight between them.\n\n\nLandmasses\nthere is a bridge connecting them.\n\n\nSongs\none of the tunes was copied from the other.\n\n\nSubsets of [42]\none is contained in another.\n\n\nIngredients\nthere is a recipe that uses them together.\n\n\nWebpages\none of them has a link leading to the other.\n\n\nTwitter Users\none of them follows the other2\n\n\nLocations on a Chessboard3\none of them is reachable from the other via a knight move.\n\n\n\nWe usually like to distinguish between graphs where the relationships are potentially one-sided (such as people in a relationship), and those where they are mutual (such as ingredients in a recipe). Edges like these are called directed and undirected, respectively.\nDepending on what the graph is modeling, we may not allow for entities to entertain relationships with themselves (e.g, flights don’t come back to airports they took off from). In other contexts, it makes sense to allow for this (e.g, a set always contains itself). An edge that connects a vertex to itself is called a self-loop4.\nSometimes, it is reasonable that there are multiple edges between a fixed pair of vertices (for example, consider that there are several recipies that use salt and potatoes). Multiple edges are useful to model a multitude of relationships, and are often called multiedges when used.\nA simple graph is one that does not have either self-loops or multiedges.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that some relationships naturally connect more two entities. For example, in an actor collaboration graph, you would find edges between Amitabh Bachchan, Juhi Chawla, and Shah Rukh Khan. You would also find edges between Akshay Kumar, Dhanush, and Sonam Kapoor. In the first example, there happens to be one film that all three actors feature in together, while this is not the case in the latter, at least at the time of this writing. As such, the graph does not have enough structure to reveal this distinction: it looks exactly the same in both cases!\nFor an actor-collaboration graph, allowing for n-way relationships would make room for accurately capturing information about both actors and movies. Indeed, every movie could be represented by an ‘edge’ — the subset of actors who belonged to the cast. Such graphs are called hypergraphs or set systems.\nWhile hypergraphs are a very useful generalization of graphs, they will be largely out of scope for our discussions in this course. To make up for that, here is a different workaround to capture all the information we have in the actor-collaboration graph example. Instead of having a vertex for every actor, we introduce a vertex for every actor and for every movie. Now, an actor a and a movie m are connected by an edge if a belongs to the cast of m. Observe that this approach can be used to “convert” any hypergraph into a graph.\nA little more terminology before we move on: I promise that we’re almost done introducing new words!\nFor an undirected graph, a vertex u is called a neighbor of a vertex v if (u,v) is an edge. For a directed graph, the presence of the edge (u,v) would make v an out-neighbor of u and u an in-neighbor of v.\nFor an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex v is the number of neighbors of v. For a directed graph, the in-degree and out-degree of v is the number of in-neighbors and out-neighbors of v, respectively."

    "text": "Representing Graphs\nIf you wanted to tell your program about a graph, there are a few different ways you could go about it. Let’s assume that we’re trying to represent a graph G on n nodes, labeled 1 through n, and m edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would you do it?\n\n\n\nBefore reading further, it would be worth spending some time thinking about how you would represent a graph. Based on our discussions so far, you might counter this with the question: “Well, what do you need it for?” — and that’s a fair reaction!\nListed below are some fairly common operations that come up when dealing with graphs.\n1. add edge u v\n2. remove edge u v\n3. add vertex v\n4. remove vertex v\n5. is u a neighbor of v?\n6. find degree v\n\n\nEdge Lists. The most natural way is to perhaps just braindump the full list of edges. This gives us all we need to know about G.\nSince this is just a plain list, you could implement it either as an array or as a linked list.\nAdjacency Matrix. The other way is to block off a n \\times n array A of integers. You could then have:\n \\begin{equation*}\n   A[i][j] =\n    \\begin{cases}\n      1 & \\text{if } (i,j) \\in E,\\\\\n      0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nAdjacency Lists. Finally, you could have an array A of size n, with A[i] pointing to a list of the neighbors of the vertex i if the graph is undirected, and out-neighbors if the graph is directed.\nAgain, since these are just lists, they could be, in principle, implemented either as arrays or linked lists. We will follow the traditional choice of implementing them as lists.\nIt should be no surprise at this point that there is no “right” answer to the choice of representation. You might have noticed, for instance, that an adjacency matrix always reserves n^2 units of space to store G, while the amount of space consumed by the other two representations is proportional to m. Notice that the number of edges in a graph can be as large as \\approx n^2 for simple graphs, so there certainly are graphs for which the space consumption looks the same for all representations. However, for graphs where there aren’t as many edges, then the matrix representation is likely wasteful in terms of space, although you may have other good reasons for sticking to it.\nLet’s classify expenses incurred as follows.\n\nBrilliant. When the procedure only needs constant time.\nDecent. When the procedure always wraps up in, and sometimes needs, time proportional to the maximum degree of the graph.\n(n/m)-tolerable. When the procedure always wraps up in, and sometimes needs, time proportional to the number of vertices/edges in the graph.\n(n/m)-painful. When the procedure always wraps up in, and sometimes needs, time proportional to the number of vertices/edges in the graph squared.\n\nHere’s a run down of how the representations above fare with respect to some of the common operations mentioned in the opening exercise.\n\n\n\nOperations\nAdj.

If G is directed, e_i is an incoming edge and e_{i+1} is an outgoing edge, and if G is undirected, these are simply two edges incident on v that can be naturally “paired off”. So any successful walk witnesses the claims above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese conditions are necessary, but are they sufficient?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that you could have graphs where these conditions are true, but there are no Euler tours. This happens when the graph is “disconnected”, i.e, when there is a pair of vertices u and v such that there is no path from u to v. The following are good exercises to work through:\n\nCome up with an example of a graph where the degree conditions are met but there is no Euler tour.\nConvince yourself that if G is connected and satisfies the degree conditions indicated above, you can always find an Euler tour."

    "text": "A naive algorithm\nNow we turn to the procedural question: knowing what it takes to find an Euler tour, how do we actually find one? First, we get the simple degree-based sanity check out of the way. For undirected graphs we have:\nfor v in V(G):\n    if deg[v] % 2 != 0:\n        return False\nand for directed graphs we have:\nfor v in V(G):\n    if indeg[v] != outdeg[v]:\n        return False\nAssuming we pass these sanity checks, we want to embark on an actual tour. Here’s a reasonable starting point, which essentially amounts to saying that you get to start anywhere, and keep going while you can:\nfind_tour(G,v):\n    // G is the graph\n    // and v is our favorite vertex\n    set curr := v\n    set S := empty\n    while there is an outgoing edge e = (curr,u) which is not in S:\n        add e to S\n        set curr := u\n    return S\nThis is basically a “keep going until stuck” process. By the very nature of the process, the sequence S that we come up with is walkable and does not repeat edges, but it is unclear if this list is exhaustive. Indeed, you should be able to come up with examples of graphs G where G has an Euler tour but find_tour(G) does not output one."

    "text": "Fixing the naive approach\nHow do we fix this? For one, we need to know if we are done or not: if an edge is missing from S, then that’s a bad sign, and we need to do something about it. How do we know if every edge is enlisted in the output? One way is to compute the length of S: if it falls short of m, we are not done yet.\nBut we also need to know what the missing edges are. We could in principle go through our edge list and ask ourselves if the edge made it to S or not, but that sounds mildly painstaking. Let’s save ourselves the pain with some additional bookkeeping — let’s track the “residual degree” of the vertices: this is the number of edges incident on v that are not yet listed in S. Any vertex with non-zero residual degree gives us concrete hints about missing edges.\nSo for directed graphs we have:\nfind_tour(G,v):\n    init res_deg[v] = outdeg[v]\n    set curr := v\n    set S := empty\n    while there is an outgoing edge e = (curr,u) which is not in S:\n        add e to S\n        res_deg[curr] = res_deg[curr]-1\n        set curr := u\n    return S\nand for undirected graphs we have:\nfind_tour(G,v):\n    init res_deg[v] = deg[v]\n    set curr := v\n    set S := empty\n    while there is an outgoing edge e = (curr,u) which is not in S:\n        add e to S\n        res_deg[curr] = res_deg[curr]-1\n        res_deg[u] = res_deg[u]-1\n        set curr := u\n    return S\nSo now we know when our algorithm is a fail. What’s the fix? Well, let’s approach vertices who are not done yet as per our intel from their res_deg value. We use these vertices to trigger more happy-go-lucky tours:\nfind_tour_fr(G):\n    i := 0\n    marked := emptyset\n    res_deg[v] := outdeg[v]\n    S := list of lists\n    while there is some v with res_deg[v] > 0:\n        let S[i] := find_tour(G,v,marked)\n        add every edge in S_i to marked\n        i = i+1\nSince we need to track visited edges across multiple runs now, we actually inform the find_tour function about the edges already visited from past lives. This is tracked with the marked set.\nSo our updated find_tour function looks like this:\nfind_tour(G,v,marked):\n    set curr := v\n    set S := empty\n    while there is an outgoing edge e = (curr,u)\n    which is not in S or marked:\n        add e to S\n        res_deg[curr] = res_deg[curr]-1\n        set curr := u\n    return S\n(The change is analogous for the version dealing with undirected graphs.)\nWhat we have now is a bunch of fragments, each of which is essentially a walk that begins and ends at the same vertex. Because of our relentless and careful pursuit (c.f. the while condition and the marked set), every edge in G features in exactly one of these fragments. Now it’s just a matter of putting everything together.\nStart with the first fragment S_0. If this is the only fragment we have, that means that our first happy-go-lucky tour was in fact also a lucky one! So we have nothing left to do. Otherwise, there are at least two fragments. Let us look at the set of vertices involved in S_0. The crucial observation is that there must be at least one other fragment, say S_i, that also features some vertex that appears in S_0. Indeed, if this is not the case, then you can argue that S_0 is a sad isolated fragment, and we can actually report that G has no Euler tour.\nOtherwise, find the common vertex between S_0 and S_i, and extend one of them using the other: for example, if v is the common vertex, take a walk in S_0 until you encounter v, and then instead of following along on S_0, take a detour as specified by S_i. Remember if you start on S_i at v, then you will eventurally exhaust S_i by coming back to v: and at this point you can “resume” your walk on S_0. Note that this process welds two fragments at the vertex v thereby reducing the total number of fragments by one. This should count as a sure sign of progress: repeating for as long as possible, we have to do this at most (f-1) many times, where f \\leq \\frac{m}{2} is the total number of fragments.\npatchup():\n    Let S[i] for i in 1, 2, ..., f denote the set of all fragments\n    while f > 1:\n        look for a fragment S[i] that intersects S[0]\n        if S[i] does not exist:\n            return false\n        else:\n            expand S[0] along S[i]\n            remove S[i] from the set of all fragments"

    "text": "Expenses\nAlthough arguably a naive algorithm, the cool thing about this procedure is that it is guaranteed to work, and the number of steps involved is not terribly bad either. Here’s a naive back-of-the-envelope analysis, assuming G is stored as an adjacency list:\n\nThe degree-based sanity checks are \\approx m since G is stored as an adjacency list.\nConsider find_tour_fr(G):\n\nThe outer while loop runs at most m times since each iteration decreases the residual degree of at least two vertices and the sum of residual degrees is 2m at the start (an analogous argument applies for directed graphs).\nThe inner while loop in find_tour(G,v,marked) is executed at most m times. To find an appropriate edge, we have to go through the negibors of curr and check if the associated edge is already in S or marked. This takes at most (nm) iterations in the worse case, if implemented directly.\nAssuming that S is a linked list and res_deg is an array, the innermost operations are all constant time.\nThe overall cost of a direct implementation is therefore nm^3.\n\nThe patchup procedure involves a outer while loop that runs at most f times if we have f fragments. The looking business to merge fragments will take no more than m units of time: worst case we have to scan all remaining fragments to find a suitable match, and the merger involves updating a few pointers — noting again that the fragments are stored as lists. This is of course a conservative estimate, but it will do. The overall time here is therefore no worse than \\approx m^2 since f \\leq \\frac{m}{2}.\n\nThis gives us m + nm^3 + m^2 in total damages. However, notice that a more careful analysis helps us do better without doing anything substantially different. If you think about find_tour_fr(G) think about how often the instructions:\nadd e to S\nres_deg[curr] = res_deg[curr]-1\nset curr := u\nfrom find_tour(G,v,marked) are actually executed. Every time we execute this set of instructions, we effectively add one edge to the set of marked edges, and since this happens exactly once per edge, these instructions only execute m times overall. Recall that what it takes to enter this loop is the discovery of an unused edge:\nwhile there is an outgoing edge e = (curr,u)\nwhich is not in S or marked\nThis is the bit that took us a while, because we assumed we have to examine all possible edges that go out of curr and then also tally up against S and marked. One way to speed this up is to always commit to pulling out the first element in the adjacency list of the vertex u and then in fact deleting this element from the list. If you are paranoid about subjecting your input to this kind of annihilation, then you can just make a working copy upfront. This way, you can be sure that you can find what you want in constant time, a good case in point to show how the way you store your data can impact the performance of your algorithm.\nBased on the hints above, convince yourself that find_tour_fr(G) in fact has a total expense amounting to \\approx m, modulo constants. With this, our overall cost comes down to \\approx 2m + m^2."

    "text": "We discussed a variety of puzzles in the genre of hat puzzles, which roughly have following story arc:\n\na bunch of (not necessarily finite (!!!)) people are in a location\nall of them are wearing hats of one of c colors, typically c = 2 (we will assume that hats are either red or blue)\nnobody knows the color of their own hat\nfolks can see the colors of other’s hats (but not necessarily all of them; this depends on the setting)\neveryone is tasked with determining/guessing the color of their own hat, and failure to get it right (most of the time) will usually lead to unpleasant outcomes\n\nA traditional special case is the following:\n\nThere are n people standing on a line.\nEveryone can see the colors of the hats of everyone ahead of them.\nA strategy for how one’s own hat color is determined can be coordinated in advance.\nStarting from the person who can see everyone else (and their hats, more importantly), to the person at the end who sees nothing, everyone spells out their guess of the color of their own hat loudly and clearly for everyone else to hear. There is no communication between poeple other than this.\nAll but one person must figure out the color of their hat correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Strategy for the Finite Case\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first person says “red” if the number of red hats s/he sees is even, and “blue” otherwise. This person may be mistaken about the color of their own hat. However, knowing the rationale for what the first person called out, the second can tally up parities to determine the color of their own hat (e.g, if the first person said red and the second person sees an even number of red hats, they conclude they are wearing a blue hat, otherwise they know they are wearing a read hat; and so on).\n\n\n\nA crazier version is the following:\n\nThere are infinitely many people in a room.\nEveryone can see the colors of the hats of everyone else, but not their own.\nNobody can hear anyone else’s guess.\nEveryone guesses simultaneously.\nIs there a strategy to ensure that infinitely many guesses are correct?\n[Level Up]: Is there a strategy to ensure that at most finitely many guesses are wrong?\n\nThis is fun to think about, and you’re probably going to have to invoke something something axiom of choice something something to tackle the situation!

    "text": "Puzzle by Joel David Hamkins.\n\n\n\nThis is apparently a logic puzzle that comes up in admission interviews at Oxford:\n\n\nAn Oxford University admissions interview question. You are a contestant on a game show, known for having perfectly logical contestants. There is another contestant, whom you've never met, but whom you can count on to be perfectly logical, just as logical as you are.\n\n— Joel David Hamkins (@JDHamkins) December 26, 2021\n\n\nThis puzzle has since been featured on the Guardian. The full setting is reproduced below from here. The source also has extended discussions about possible solutions — you have been warned!\nYou are a contestant on a game show, known for having perfectly logical contestants. There is another contestant, whom you’ve never met, but whom you can count on to be perfectly logical, just as logical as you are.\nThe game is cooperative, so either you will both win or both lose, together. Imagine the stakes are very high—perhaps life and death. You and your partner are separated from one another, in different rooms. The game proceeds in turns—round 1, round 2, round 3, as many as desired to implement your strategy.\nOn each round, each contestant may choose either to end the game and announce a color (any color) to the game host or to send a message (any kind of message) to their partner contestant, to be received before the next round. Messages are sent simultaneously, crossing in transit.\nYou win the game if on some round both players opt to end the game and announce a color to the host and furthermore they do so with exactly the same color. That is, you win if you both halt the game on the same round with the same color. lf only one player announces a color, or if both do but the colors don’t match, then the game is over, but you have lost.\nRound 1 is about to begin. What do you do?\nVariations:\nAlternation variation. In this variation of the puzzle, the contestants alternate in their right to send messages—only contestant 1 can send on round 1, then contestant 2 on round 2 and so forth, but still they aim to announce the same color on a round. You are contestant 1—what do you do?\nCollision variation. In this variation, players may opt on each round either to end the game and announce a color, to send a message, or to do nothing. But the new thing is that if both players opt to send a message, then the messages collide and are not delivered, although an error message is generated (so the players know what happened). What do you do?\nPigeon variation. This version is like the alternating turn variation, except that now the contestants are separated at much greater distance, and the messages are sent by carrier pigeon, so neither can be sure that the messages actually arrive. You are contestant 1—what do you do?"

(1/9) pic.twitter.com/6lportLU9V\n\n— Grant Sanderson (@3blue1brown) March 14, 2022\n\n\nA spoiler-free version of the thread above is reproduced below:\nDeath finds you. You plead with him that it’s too soon, and he agrees to a concession. Every year, he’ll roll a set of dice, and if it turns up snake eyes (both 1’s) he’ll take your life, otherwise, you get one more year.\nBut it’s not necessarily a normal pair of dice.\nOn the first year, both “dice” will only have two sides, numbered 1 and 2. So in that first year, there’s a 25% chance of rolling snake eyes and ending things there.\nOn the second year, he comes with tetrahedral dice, i.e. both are four-sided, numbered 1 through 4, and again only takes your life if he rolls two 1’s.\nThe next year, the dice are six-sided, after that, eight-sided, etc., etc.\nEach year you have a lower and lower chance of dying, but he’ll come back every year with a new set of dice, never stopping.\nYou might think the question now is something like “what’s your expected number of remaining years of life?”\nBut actually, Death gave you a pretty good deal.\nThe better question to ask here is “what’s the probability that you end up immortal?” That is, the probability that Death rolls infinitely many times, with his ever-growing dice, and never once turns up snake eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn image that shows a square circumscribed inside a circle."

Assume that no three points of \\mathcal{S} are collinear. By a windmill we mean a process as follows. Start with a line \\ell going through a point P \\in \\mathcal{S}. Rotate \\ell clockwise around the pivot P until the line contains another point Q of \\mathcal{S}. The point Q now takes over as the new pivot. This process continues indefinitely, with the pivot always being a point from \\mathcal{S}.\nShow that for a suitable P \\in \\mathcal{S} and a suitable starting line \\ell containing P, the resulting windmill will visit each point of \\mathcal{S} as a pivot infinitely often.\n\n Spoiler: a neat 3blue1brown video and lesson on the solution."

    "text": "Shared by @10kdiver.\n\n\n\nA probability puzzle involving tournaments and elimination matches:\n\n\nHere’s a neat probability puzzle — somewhat counter-intuitive: pic.twitter.com/QA6jxaIYFT\n\n— 10-K Diver (@10kdiver) September 23, 2022\n\n\nTo begin with, a clarification: to say that Alex is the best player is to say that Alex will always win a match that he plays; and to say that Bob is the second best player is to say that Bob will win any match that he plays other than one against Alex. The puzzle asks for the probability that Bob emerges the runner up in the tournament. This is indicated in the tweet but the crop seems to hide it.\nSuppose we denote the players \\{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4\\}, and say the players are initially matched up like so:\n(a_1,a_2); (a_3,a_4); (b_1,b_2); (b_3,b_4),\nand in particular we have:\n\none of the quarter finals will be between a_p and a_q for p \\in \\{1,2\\} and q \\in \\{3,4\\},\nthe quarter finals will be between b_r and b_s for r \\in \\{1,2\\} and s \\in \\{3,4\\}, and\nthe semi finals will be between an a-player and a b-player.\n\nA moment’s reflection reveals that for Bob to be a runner up, he should not meet Alex in the quarter-finals or earlier. This happens if and only if:\n\neither Alex is one of the a-players and Bob is one of the b-players, or\nBob is one of the a-players and Alex is one of the b-players.\n\nFrom here it is a counting argument. I was distracted by some idea of symmetry and originally jumped to the conclusion that the answer is one-half. Spoiler alert: I quickly learned that it’s not!"

The answer may surprise you!(I'll post a solution tomorrow.) pic.twitter.com/m1c8u0J5MN\n\n— 10-K Diver (@10kdiver) March 23, 2022\n\n\nNow for the harder version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of people will exchange gifts at a holiday party. Each person brings a gift to the party and attaches a label with a unique number to this gift. These numbers are also put on cards, which are deposited in a box and shuffled. Each person at the party then sequentially draws a card from the box, and receives the gift whose label corresponds to the number on the card drawn. If the number corresponds to his or her own gift, the card is returned to the box and the person draws another card. Of course, it is not possible for the last person to draw a second card.\nWhat is the probability that the last person is left with the card corresponding to his or her own present? In the simple case of two people, the probability is zero. The problem is also easy to solve in the case of three people, using a chance tree. It is no restriction to imagine that the persons are numbered as 1, 2 and 3 like the labels of their presents, and that they draw a card in this order. Then person 1 gets either the present with label 2 or the present with label 3, each with a probability of 1/2. If person 1 gets the present with label 3, then the conditional probability of the last person 3 to get his or her own present is zero. If person 1 gets the present with label 2, then the cards with labels 1 and 3 are left and person 2 draws the card with label 1 with probability of 1/2, in which case the last person 3 is left with the card of his or her own present. Therefore the probability that the last person will be left with the card of his or her own present is ½ × 0 + ½ × ½ = ¼.\nThe challenges for this week are these: What is the probability that the card left for the last person corresponds to his or her own present when there are four people at the party? What is the probability when there are five people at the party?\n\n\nSource NB. may be paywalled"

    "text": "Contributed by Debanuj Nayak.\n\n\n\nThere are 5 boxes with lids kept in a row.\n[] [] [] [] []\nLet’s call them B[1…5].\nThere is a puppy P inside one of these boxes.\nOur goal is to find the puppy.\n[?] [?] [?] [?] [?]\nEvery morning you get a chance to open any one of the boxes. If you find the puppy: great, congrats!\nIf you don’t, tough luck, you have to wait again for the next day. Meanwhile, during the night, the Puppy will move to one of the neighbouring boxes.(can’t stay in same box). Eg:\n[] [P] [] [] [] -> [P] [] [] [] [] or [] [] [P] [] [].\n\nDoes there exist protocols (ways of opening boxes) in which I can guarantee that I can catch the puppy in a finite time?\nIf yes, what is the smallest number of days I have to wait to catch the puppy (Which is the best protocol?)\nHow does this protocol work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoilers: based on our discussion in the second TGIF meetup.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a strategy that uses seven days (h/t: Harshil).\nMorning 1: Open Box 2. If it contains P, we are done. Otherwise, P is in one of Box 1,3,4 or 5.\nMorning 2: Open Box 2. If it contains P, we are done. Otherwise, P is in one of Box 3,4 or 5.\nMorning 3: Open Box 3. If it contains P, we are done. Otherwise, P is in one of Box 2,4 or 5.\nMorning 4: Open Box 4. If it contains P, we are done. Otherwise, P is in one of Box 1,3 or 5.\nMorning 5: Open Box 4. If it contains P, we are done. Otherwise, P is in Box 2.\nMorning 6: Open Box 3. If it contains P, we are done. Otherwise, P is in Box 1.\nMorning 7: Open Box 2. It definitely contains P.\n\nHere’s a strategy that uses six days (h/t: Debanuj):\nFirst Observation: The puppy P alternates between odd and even boxes\nSecond Observation: The puppy P only has one possible choice to go to, if it is in Box 1 or Box n\nLet us assume that P is in an even box i.e. B[2] or B[4] on the first morning.\nMorning 1: Check B[2], if you find P, done. Otherwise, according to the assumption, P is in B[4]\nNight 1: P moves to B[3] or B[5]\nMorning 2: Check B[3], if you find P, done. Otherwise P is in B[5] according to initial assumption.\nNight 2: P moves to B[4], no other choice.\nMorning 3: Check B[4]. If assumption was true, then P must be in B[4]. If you find P, done. If you don’t find P, that means initial assumption was false.\nThus on morning 1, P was in an odd box ⇒ on morning3 (today), P is again in an odd box. Which means tomorrow (morning 4), P must be in an even box.\nNight 3: P moves to B[2] or B[4]\nMorning 4: Now our assumption holds true that P is in an even box, and now you can repeat the procedure we followed on mornings 1,2,3 again on mornings 4,5,6 and we are guaranteed to catch P.\n\n\n\nUnresolved questions:\n\nCan we do this in five days? Or can we show that it’s impossible to come up with a protocol that uses only five days?\nWhat about six boxes? Or seven? Or n?\nIf the moves are equiprobable and the initial choice is uniformly random, what is the expected number of moves executed by either of the strategies above?\nHow much faster can we do this if we are allowed to open two boxes at once?\nQuestion from Bireswar: If the puppy is allowed to stay put, then there’s no protocol to find the puppy even in the trivial setting with two boxes. What if we are allowed to open more than one box? How many more boxes do we need to be able to open per day to catch a potentially non-moving puppy amongst five boxes?"

Put a square piece of paper (14 cm x 14 cm) completely inside a bag (20 cm x 11 cm) without folding, cutting, or rolling up the paper; it should end up lying completely flat. pic.twitter.com/nGv2TwR8Wp\n\n— Dave Richeson (@divbyzero) October 4, 2022\n\n\nWhen we discussed this in the meetup, it was a little hard to describe what’s allowed and what’s not with the bag. Another thing that was important to emphasize is the side of the bag that is open: I am not sure this is even possible if the bag is sealed on both the long sides and only the short side is the one that is open.\nA quick sanity check with respect to surface areas reassures us of the potential feasibility of the task: the total surface area of the square is indeed smaller than the surface area of the bag. So if you imagine cutting the bag along the short sides, and using it as a gift wrap to cover up the square, that’s very much doable.\nThe other hint was the fact that the length of the diagonal of the square is less than the length of the longer side of the bag. This prompts us to line up the square so that it’s opposite corners align with the long and open edge of the bag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution does indeed involve starting here and squishing the bag gradually so that it engulfs the square. Here’s a nice video demonstration:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe did wonder about formalizing the question and the process above a little more, but we were not able to come up with any appropriate language. At least as an activity-based puzzle I think the instructions are quite clear:\n\n\nAh. The bag can stretch and fold as much as any ordinary kitchen bag can. And for that matter, the paper can warp and bend as you'd expect it would. But in the end everything will end up flat on the tabletop.\n\n— Dave Richeson (@divbyzero) October 7, 2022\n\n\nIt would be nice to be come up with a procedure that, given the dimensions of the square and the bag, can determine if the square can in fact be accommodated in the bag playing by the rules here. Already here, it was pointed out later that it would have worked with a slightly smaller bag too, and at least for the purpose of getting to this particular solution, all that matters is the proportions of the side lengths.\nIt might also be interesting to think about what happens with other combinations of shapes."

The last 60 bees of the species are in your terrarium. You’ve already constructed wire frames of the appropriate size and shape. Now you need to turn them into working beehives by filling every hex with wax. Can you help the bees create producing hives? Dan Finkel shows how.\n\nThis is very reminiscent of the puzzle about lighting up a grid. The main difference here appears to be that the structure of the base grid is hexagonal, as opposed to being a square grid."

    "text": "This puzzle was sourced from an @algopuzzles tweet.\n\n\n\nHere’s the puzzle:\n\n\nOn an nxn grid a few nodes are set on fire at t=0. The fire spreads like this: if at least two neighboring nodes of node x are lit, then node x will also catch fire in the next time step. What's the minimum number of nodes that have to be lit to burn the entire grid?#exportober\n\n— Algorithmic Puzzles (@algopuzzles) October 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s an argument for the lower bound by Harshil Mittal.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider an arbitrary but fixed solution. Let p denote the number of nodes that are lit up at time 0. Let T denote the time taken to lit the entire grid. WLOG, assume that for each 1 \\leq t \\leq T, exactly one new node is lit up at time t.\nAt any time 0 \\leq t \\leq T,\n\nFor every lit node (i,j), let f(i,j,t) denote the number of edges of the node (i,j) that are not shared with another lit node.\nLet g(t) denote the sum of f(i,j,t) over all lit nodes (i,j)\n\nWe show that g(t+1) \\leq g(t) for all 0 \\leq t \\leq T-1.\nLet 0 \\leq t \\leq T-1. Let (u,v) denote the new node which is lit up at time t+1. Let X denote the set of all lit neighbors of (u,v) at time t. For every node (i,j) in X, we have f(i,j,t+1) = f(i,j,t) - 1. Also, note that f(u,v,t+1) = 4-|X|. Therefore, g(t+1) = g(t) - |X| + (4-|X|) = g(t) + 4-2|X|. So, as |X| \\geq 2, we get g(t+1) \\leq g(t).\nNow, we have 4n = g(T) \\leq g(0) \\leq 4p. Thus, n \\leq p, as desired."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My attempted overview of options for making websites with Notion does not go into the mechanics of how to setup a site with Notion, so I’m going to post a couple of short walkthroughs of the process here. I’ll demonstrate with both Super and Potion. For Super, I’ll share how I setup my course catalog. With Potion, a natural choice would have been to take you behind the scenes of this blog, but this did involve a little bit of customization that might be a bit distracting, so I’ll just make something quick from scratch for this post.\n\n\nDoesn't look like it's for non-geeks like me 😄 or you may prove otherwise. However, if you can record a 10 min video setting up a basic one, that'll have a greater impact, I believe, if it's already not there.\n\n— Swaprava Nath (@swaprava) September 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\nThe Overall Process\nFor either framework, this is typically a three-step process:\n\nSetup your content in Notion. You can start from scratch, or use one of the templates provided by Super or Potion that feel like a closest match to what you want your website to eventually look like.\nEnable sharing to the web from within Notion — this will generate a link for you.\nCopy this link into Super or Potion.\n\nAt the end of step 2, in fact, you already have a URL that you can share with anyone and, depending on how the content is laid out in Notion, can already look like a decent website.\nWhat step 3 allows you to do, however is:\n\nAdd some styling with CSS.\nAdd custom code snippets (useful, for example, if you want to add things like Google Analytics).\nBe assured that the webpage is good in terms of SEO, performance, etc.\nIf using Super, you can selectively password-protect pages (coming soon to Potion, where you can presently password-protect your whole site if you want to).\nHave automatically generated user-friendly URLs for the individual pages, and if on Potion, you get nice preview images for all your pages as well.\n\nA few optional steps that you might want to consider:\n\nBy default, both Super and Potion will give you a test subdomain to work with. Eventually, you might want the website to be available from your own domain. This is just a matter of adding a couple of A-records and typically can be done from wherever you registered the domain:\n\n\n\n\nYou might want to add custom styles to make the website render uniquely — so you move beyond the standard look-and-feel of a Notion page if you so wish. You could do something on your own here, but the simplest thing is to just borrow the styling from one of the existing templates and tweak it if you want.\nInsert code for Google Analytics (or similar). As an aside, if you are looking for analytics that is user-friendly and privacy-conscious, I’d recommend Fathom.\n\n\n\nA Course Catalog with Super\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeads up!\n\n\n\nThis content is deprecated because I’ve moved this domain out to a different setup now. So please ignore the links, and hopefully the steps are still useful in principle!\n\n\nLet’s apply this process to an actual website now! I’ll demonstrate how I setup the website at neeldhara.courses. Incidentally, if you want a quick overview without some details that will be specific to my website, you might want to watch the video made by @robhope and pointed out by @traf.\n\n\nHere's a little run through by @robhope on creating a site @super_:https://t.co/SCMdDMRfBd\n\n— traf (@traf) September 12, 2021\n\n\nBack to the setup for neeldhara.courses. You can check out the page on Notion here, but I’ll describe some pieces of it below. First, recall Step 1:\n\n1️⃣ Setup your content in Notion.\n\nI started with the Super template HQ. It looks amazing and is apparently free to use — at least at the time of this writing 😀\nDuplicate this template into Notion. If you like, you can duplicate it twice — one, a copy that you actually work on, and the other could be a copy that you don’t edit but just keep handy in case you need to go back to the original for reference.\nThe first thing I did was to get rid of most of the content, and just retained this section:\n\nwhich, incidentally, will render like this once connected to Super:\n\nNow the next step is to replace the generic content with yours:\n\nSince I’m just starting out, I have added the three courses that I’m teaching this term and they all show up. Eventually, these courses will be filtered out based on the current timing, so that only the current ones show here and the rest get pushed to an archive — which I’m yet to build. But the filter would look something like this in Notion:\n\nAnd for each of those entries, I’d go and setup the course home pages with the content that I have in my typical course homepages. The nice thing about Notion is the wide array of content types that lets you format things nicely. Here are a couple of sections from within Notion:\n\n\nOne thing worth pointing out for this particular setup — for each course, the class plan is just a Notion database, where the columns are:\n\nName (text)\nWeek (single-select with 12 options; one for each week of the course)\nModule (a checkbox property)\nDescription (text)\n\nand the rows either correspond to an overview of a whole week or just one individual lecture, tagged with the week that it happened in.\nOn the course’s homepage, I display this database set to a Gallery view, and filtered to only those entries where the Module option is unchecked. These are intended to be overview pages. This is what it looks like in Notion:\n\nand this is what it will end up looking like on the website, once you’ve gotten to the end of Step 3:\n\nFurther, overview page simply displays the same database again, this time in a list view filtered by the appropriate week:\n\nCheck out the views in Notion and the rendered version side-by-side:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might wonder about the blockquote in the Notion view right at the top of the page. That’s a feature of the HQ template — anything that goes into that first blockquote renders as page navigation on top. I think this now a bit obsolete with Super’s new features on navigation bars, but I still find it handy and use it on most pages. 👍\nSo that’s all of Step 1, getting all your content inside Notion. I’d say this is really the bulk of the process. The process is iterative, so you don’t need literally all your content in before you can move on. However, getting an indicative amount thrown in is, I think, useful.\nOnce you’re done with this bit, up next:\n\n2️⃣ Enable sharing to the web from within Notion — this will generate a link for you.\n\nThis is very easy to do, it’s just a toggle on the top-right corner of your Notion app:\n\nNow for the final step to have everything come together:\n\n3️⃣ Copy this link into Super or Potion.\n\nThis is again quite straightforward, head to Super and just share your page’s public URL, give it a name, and optionally set it up to sync with your domain if you have one.\n\nGiven that we’re using a particular Super template, you would also need to remember to insert the CSS to make the site look as advertised above 😅\nSo remember to add this on the custom code section of your Super dashboard:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"[https://sites.super.so/hq/style.css](https://sites.super.so/hq/style.css)\">\nIf you do just this and are literally following along your site may still look a little different from mine, which is probably because I tweaked the CSS a bit to incorporate fonts of my liking (the fonts in the screenshot are from Google fonts — Andika New Basic and Shadows into Light Two).\nYou might want to take care of some minor things at this stage, such as adding a favicon, a site description that will show up on Google searches, inserting any code you need to for analytics, and so forth.\nThe very first time that you setup your site, you may need to wait for a bit for it to build and render. But after this first time, any edits you make on Notion are reflected automatically on your website — you may need to give it a minute or two, it’s not instantaneous, but trust that the changes will show up. Clear your cache if they don’t even after a couple of minutes.\nSuper generates pretty URLs automatically for all your pages, but because of the slightly peculiar setup I have, involving a particular nested structure and filtered views, I’ve been doing my pretty URLs manually. For example, to go to the second module of Week 5 in the competitive programming course, the URL is:\nhttps://neeldhara.courses/competitive-programming/week-05/mod-02\nThis can be setup quite easily from inside the Super dashboard, and once it’s done once, it’s done for good.\nSo, that’s about it! I’d like to think I covered most major aspects, but if anything is unclear, ping me @neeldhara on Twitter and I’ll be sure to update this appropriately 🙂\n\n\nThe Manim Examples Collection with Potion\nFor the Potion example, I’d like to build out a quick page with latest tweets from @manim_community. Manim is a community-maintained Python library for creating mathematical animations, and the twitter handle pulls in a lot of great examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally, if you prefer watching a video tutorial, Potion has you covered already…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, for step 1, which is to get our content in Notion, I start with a blank slate and populate it with some content:\n\n\nFor Step 2, I simply make this page public, and you can see the Notion version here.\nFor Step 3, I add this page to Potion and just follow step 4 on this page to set this up with a lovely template made by Dr. Gil Pradana (@gildy). This just amounts to copy-pasting some CSS code into the Snippet Injection section of your Potion dashboard. This template treats horizontal line breaks as breakpoints to create cards, and the headings translate into the highlight boxes that you can see from this preview.\nhttps://twitter.com/gildy/status/1403680404092035075?s=20\nAfter connecting my domain, here’s what the website looks like this\nAnd that’s basically it! You have a fully functional page now. 🎉 Changes you make in Notion will reflect instantaneously on Potion!\n\nYou might wonder if there is a way of setting things up so that new tweets from the Manim community handle show up automatically on this website. In principle, this should be possible with a little help from tools like automate.io, Zapier, or Integromat — they can watch for new tweets and append them to the page you are working on, although I’m not sure how to set it up so that they respect the two-column layout that I have here. I figure tweets could also be added to a database and shown with a gallery view instead, but the gallery previews will typically not pick up embedded content, so you might have to go via an intermediate service like Tweetpik or Pikaso instead so you have screenshots for display.\nSo this was Potion - you can probably see the many ways in which Potion and Super are similar to setup. By the way, the templates on these platforms are not mutually compatible — so watch out for the fact that they will not automatically work on the other platform if you are looking to migrate. As far as I can see, neither service has an importer for the other built yet.\nThat said, I hope you have fun making your website with Notion with whatever platform you choose to use! 🎉"

    "text": "Background\nKidney paired donation or paired exchange allows donors to donate their kidneys to compatible patients with the understanding that their patients receive medically compatible kidneys in turn. The central problem in this setting is the clearing problem — which involves matching patients to donors in such a way that a maximum number of patients receive compatible kidneys. We introduce a directed graph as a convenient abstraction for this question, where:\n\neach node v_i = (P_i,D_i) represents a patient-donor pair, and\nwe introduce a directed edge v_i → v_j if the kidney of the donor D_i is compatible with the patient P_j.\n\nObserve that a cycle in this directed graph naturally represents a sequence of feasible exchanges within the cycle. For example, imagine that we have a three-cycle with the edges:\n(P_2,D_2) → (P_5,D_5) → (P_7,D_7) → (P_2,D_2)\nThen we have the following compatible donations:\n\nP_5 is assigned the kidney of donor D_2\nP_7 is assigned the kidney of donor D_5\nP_2 is assigned the kidney of donor D_7\n\nThis accounts for all the patients and donors involved in this cycle and motivates the following question:\n\nGiven a directed graph, what is the largest number of vertices that can be covered by a disjoint union of cycles?\n\nWhile a positive answer to this question will “resolve” all the needs in the system, consider that exchanges along a cycle of length \\ell involve \\ell simultaneous operations to mitigate the risks involved with donors potentially backing out of the exchange agreements.\nThis motivates the following refinement of the previously posed question:\n\nGiven a directed graph, what is the largest number of vertices that can be covered by a disjoint union of cycles, where each cycle is of length \\ell or less?\n\nIf the exchanges are restricted to swaps, that is, \\ell = 2, the problem reduces to finding a maximum matching. However, the problem is NP-complete already when \\ell = 3 (see Theorem 1, Abraham, Blum, and Sandholm; EC 2007).\nWe now generalize the model a little further to account for the presence of altruistic donors, who are donors without a matching patient and are willing to donate to any compatible patient. To account for the presence of such donors, we modify our graph representation as follows:\n\nEach node either:\n\nrepresents a patient-donor pair v_i = (P_i,D_i) or\nrepresents an altruistic donor u_k = D_k^\\star\n\nThe edges are as follows:\n\nWe have a directed edge v_i → v_j if the kidney of the donor D_i is compatible with the patient P_j.\nWe have a directed edge u_k → v_j if the kidney of the donor D_k^\\star is compatible with the patient P_j.\n\n\nIn this setting, note that we can also facilitate exchanges along paths as well, with the paths starting at the altruistic donors. For instance, if we have the path:\n(D_7^\\star) → (P_2,D_2) → (P_5,D_5) → (P_7,D_7) → (P_3,D_3)\nThen we have the following compatible donations:\n\nP_2 is assigned the kidney of donor D_7^\\star\nP_5 is assigned the kidney of donor D_2\nP_7 is assigned the kidney of donor D_5\nP_3 is assigned the kidney of donor D_7\n\nNote that in this situation, the donor D_3 is relieved from any obligation to donate to a patient. We now update our problem statement to reflect the presence of altrustic donors and the possibility of facilitating exchanges along paths:\n\n🤝 Optimal Kidney Exchange Along Short Paths and Cycles\nInput. A directed graph G = (V,E), where \\mathcal{A} \\subseteq V are source vertices; and positive integers \\ell_p, \\ell_c and t.\nOutput. Yes if and only if there is a collection of cycles of length at most \\ell_c each and a collection of paths of length at most \\ell_p each such that the cycles and paths altogether covers t nodes outside of \\mathcal{A}.\n\nThe main claim in the context of this problem is the following:\nThere exists a \\mathcal{O}(2^{\\mathcal{O}(t)} \\cdot \\text{poly}(n)) that decides Optimal Kidney Exchange Along Short Paths and Cycles."

    "section": "An Algorithm for OKE",
    "text": "An Algorithm for OKE\nHere’s a high-level description of the algorithm (perhaps best approached with some prior familiarity with color coding). To begin with, notice that we may assume without loss of generality that \\ell_p \\leq t and \\ell_c \\leq t — intuitively, this is because if the permitted cycle and path lengths are longer than the number of patients we hope to cover, then we can simply look for cycles or paths of length t directly to begin with — if we find one, then we are done, and if none exist, then we “might as well” set \\ell_p and/or \\ell_c to t-1.\nNow, if there is a solution that accounts for at least t patients, there is also one that involves at most 2t patients and in particular, also at most t paths. Such a solution engages at most t nodes from \\mathcal{A}. Therefore, if there is a solution, then there is one that spans s \\leq 3t vertices.\nAs is standard for color coding, we guess the correct value of s and randomly partition the vertex set V into s parts. The hope is that each part contains exactly one vertex from the solution (this is a so-called “colorful solution”). The probability that a random partition is a lucky one is (3t)!/(3t)^{(3t)}, which turns out to be at least e^{-3t}. This implies that e^{3t} repetitions ensure a constant success probability.\nGiven that the partition is indeed a lucky one, we can recover the solution using the following dynamic programming semantics. For C \\subseteq [3t] and i \\in [3t], let D[C,i] be TRUE if and only if there is a colorful solution spanning at least i nodes outside \\mathcal{A} in G[V_C], where V_C denotes the subset of vertices colored with colors from C.\nThe recurrence is based on isolating one path or cycle by guessing the set of colors involved in said component and using table lookups to figure out if this can be extended to a full solution.\nIn particular, we have:\nD[C,i] = P[C,i] \\lor Q[C,i],\nwhere\nP[C,i] = \\lor_{(B,j): B \\subseteq C \\text{ and } 1 \\leq j \\leq \\ell_c} [D[C \\setminus B, i - j] \\land f(B,j)]\nand\nQ[C,i] = \\lor_{(B,j): B \\subseteq C \\text{ and } 1 \\leq j \\leq \\ell_p} [D[C \\setminus B, i - j] \\land g(B,j)].\nHere, we have that:\n\nf(B,j) is TRUE if and only if the vertices of B can be covered with a cycle of length j.\ng(B,j) is TRUE if and only if the vertices of B can be covered with a path of length j.\n\nThe truth values of f(B,j) and g(B,j) can be determined directly using standard approaches to finding colorful paths and cycles in time that is single-exponential in j.\nTo claim the overall running time, note that:\n\nThe total number of entries in the table is 2^{O(t)} \\cdot t and each entry can be computed in time \\mathcal{O}^{}\\left(2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\ell)}\\right).\nTherefore, the algorithm outputs the correct decision in \\mathcal{O}^{}\\left(2^{\\mathcal{O}(t)}\\right) time with probability at least e^{-3t},\nBy repeating \\mathcal{O}\\left(e^{3 t}\\right) times, we find the correct decision with constant success probability.\nThe overall running time is \\mathcal{O}^{*}\\left(2^{\\mathcal{O}(t)}\\right)."

Such patients would be the last vertices on paths kickstarted by altruistic donors. However, this notion likely does not manifest in practice.\n\nIf you’d like to dig deeper, be sure to check out the preprint! A few additional pointers:\n\nThis work closely builds on the works of Xiao and Wang (IJCAI, 2018), who proposed an exact algorithm with running time \\mathcal{O}(2^nn^3) where n is the number of vertices in the underlying graph. They also show an FPT algorithm parameterized by the number of vertex types if we do not have any restriction on the length of cycles and chains.\nLin, Wang, Feng, and Fu (Algorithms, 2019) studied the version of the kidney exchange problem which allows only cycles and developed a randomized parameterized algorithm with respect to the parameter being (number of patients receiving a kidney, maximum allowed length of any cycle).\nAlvin E. Roth was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences 2012 (along with Lloyd S. Shapley) in part for his pioneering contributions to the theory and practice of kidney exchange — his biographical account indicates that he had started anticipating the problem even before it emerged as a legal practice. His talk at Simons Institute surveys “fifteen years of history” in the kidney exchange problem, with an emphasis on the game-theoretic aspects. (h/t: Rohit’s blog on this topic.)"

It’s addictive — and NP-complete* even when you’re dealing only with rooks!\n*when appropriately generalized\n\n\n\nThe Rules of the Game\n\n\nSo this is a single-player, peg-solitaire-ish chess variant, where you have to clear board by making a sequence of valid captures, albeit starting with unorthodox — and even unrealistic — positions.\n\n\n\nAn example position\n\n\nTo begin with the boards start easy, with a few pieces at a time. Notice, even in the early games, how some positions have just one solution while others may have several.\n\n\n\nMore positions\n\n\nFrom initial plays, you sense that it has a very Hamiltonian-Path-ish vibe, and feels like you’re trying to find a path in some graph 😅 \nWe started with a variant that was simultaneously a generalization and specialization:\n\nn pieces 😎\n♖’s only\n1D boards 🙈\n\nThis, it turns out, is case so special that its trivial - you can sweep all rooks to the extreme left or extreme right of the board, and any position is winning even if every rook can capture exactly once. Less trivial though: how many ways there are to win? 🤔\nWe also ask what happens if every rook had a designated number of captures left. Imagine you have a 1D board and three kinds of rooks:\n\nred rooks cannot move\nblue rooks can move at most once\ngreen rooks can move at most twice\n\n\n\n\n1D Boards\n\n\nWe show that such 1D boards can be cleared if and only if then number of green rooks is at least the number of red rooks. This ties nicely with the intuition that every immovable rook needs to be picked up by a rook that can help another one (i.e, > one move left).\nThis generalizes naturally to rooks with a designated number of moves left, where said number can be anything between 0 and d. Since no other chess piece moves sensibly* across a 1D board, we decided to move on 2D boards from here.\n\nKings + rooks is an easy exercise.\n\nSo if you are still playing with red, blue, and green rooks, then the problem of checking if a given 2D configuration can be cleared up according to solo chess rules turns out to be NP-complete.\nNo Hamiltonian Path though — this one was from bipartite dominating set 😎\n\n\n\nA reduction from bipartite dominating set - I\n\n\n\n\n\nA reduction from bipartite dominating set - II\n\n\nBishops are much the same as rooks, by a 45-degree tilt of the board.\n⚠️ Still open though: what about the case when all pieces have at most two moves left, which is closer to the original spirit of the game?\nWe don’t know yet, although we’d bet it’s hard, I think.\nWhen playing with queens only, however, we can gadget in the behaviors of red and blue pieces. So we do have that Generalized Solo Chess with just queens that can all move at most twice is NP-complete.\nWhat about pawns? Let’s get clarifying assumptions out of the way:\n\nwhite pawns only\nregular captures only since there’s no premise for en passant captures\n\nIn solo chess, pawns are (heavily) constrained bishops: they can only move upwards and to a neighboring diagonal square. Knowing that bishops were hard, but pawns felt simple — we didn’t have a bet either way. 🤔\nWe were pleasantly surprised that the case of pawns is tractable, even when each pawn has a designated* number of moves!\n*at most two.\n\n\n\nLemma for pawns\n\n\nThe algorithm is linear time, too.\nNext: what about knights? We don’t know yet!\n❓ What’s the complexity of solo chess when played only with knights?\nKnights are special because we don’t have to worry about obstructions. So the game can be described by a more general token game on graphs:\n\n\n\nThe Graph Capture Problem\n\n\nWe do show that Graph Capture is hard by a reduction, again from bipartite dominating set. This might hint at the hardness for Solo Chess played with knights only, but we are not betting on this yet.\n\n\n\nAnother reduction from bipartite dominating set - I\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother reduction from bipartite dominating set - II\n\n\nI think these preliminary explorations have left us with more questions than answers:\n\noptimization versions (e.g, clear at least k pieces)\nother constraints (e.g, on distance moved)\nspecial cases (e.g, O(1) pieces per row/column)\nn x c boards, constant c\n\nWhile at it, I’m also curious about how @chesscom generates these puzzles, and if they have a mechanism for generating ones that have unique solutions. Also, is it true that if you throw “enough” pieces on the board, it’s solvable WHP?\nShout out to the skak package for making it easy to bring chess pieces to TikZ. We expect to put up a preprint on ArXiV soon. 👀  Meanwhile, we welcome comments and feedback — and if you read this far, thanks very much!\nPS.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Presenting the 15 puzzle:\n\nThis is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1–15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Johnson & Story (1879) used a parity argument to show that half of the starting positions for the n-puzzle are impossible to resolve, no matter how many moves are made. We are going to explore two approaches* parity-based argument to show that the puzzle shown here on the right is unsolvable.\n*I do believe the two proofs are essentially the same with slight differences of language.\n\n\n\nAn example of the 15 puzzle\n\n\nCommon to both approaches is the idea of associating a permutation with every state of the puzzle. For the purposes of this discussion, we will think of a permutation simply as a sequence of elements. To turn the grid layout into a sequence, you could, for instance, line up the rows next to each other, in other words, read off the numbers from left-to-right and top-to-bottom:\n\n\n\nAssociating the puzzle with a permutation\n\n\nSo we think of every puzzle state as a permutation over the set \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 15\\} \\cup \\{\\star\\}, where we use \\star to denote the blank space. For a particular sequence \\sigma and an index 1 \\leq i \\leq 16, we will use \\sigma_i to refer to the element that is at the i^{th} position in the sequence \\sigma.\nA couple of definitions in the context of permutations will be useful:\n\nAn inversion is a pair of elements that is out of their natural order. More precisely, if we have indices i < j such that \\sigma_i > \\sigma_j, then the pair (i,j) indulges in an inversion. Note that the starting state of our puzzle here has exactly one inversion.\nA transposition of locations i and j **is essentially a swap of the elements at positions i and j of a given permutation. So this is an operation performed on a permutation. Let’s say this again with more explicit notation — if we start with \\sigma, then the permutation \\tau obtained from \\sigma by a transposition of i and j is given by the following:\n\n\n\\tau_\\ell = \\begin{cases}\n      \\sigma_j & \\text{if } \\ell = i,\\\\\n      \\sigma_i & \\text{if } \\ell = j,\\\\\n      \\sigma_\\ell & \\text{otherwise.}\n    \\end{cases}\n\nThe identity permutation, which we will denote by \\iota, is special — it’s the following sequence:\n\n\\{1,2,\\ldots,14,15,\\star\\}.\n\nIt turns out that every permutation \\sigma can be obtained from the identity permutation by a sequence of transpositions. This is not terribly hard to see — start with the identity permutation, and repeat the following until the permutation at hand is the one you want to see: find a location i that’s messed up in the current permutation, i.e, it doesn’t have the element you need in there. Find where the element is in the current permutation, and if that’s location j, you could perform a transposition between i and j. This fixes up the location i. In every step, you fix at least one location, and never mess up anything else: so at the end of at most n steps (assuming you are working with a sequence of n elements), you would be done. 🎉\nFor example, suppose the permutation you want to obtain is 3,4,2,1. Here is how the argument above would play out:\n\n1,2,3,4. The first location is messed up, so swap 1 and 3.\n3,2,1,4. The second location is messed up, so swap 2 and 4.\n3,4,1,2. The third location is messed up, so swap 1 and 2.\n3,4,2,1. Now we are done.\n\nNote that this may not be the only way of performing a sequence of transpositions that can morph \\iota into \\sigma — there may be various roads to \\sigma. However, it turns out that no matter what route you take to transform \\iota \\longrightarrow \\sigma, the number of steps you perform will always have the same parity. So specifically, it’s not possible for you to have a series of, say, seventeen transpositions that turn \\iota into \\sigma, and for me to have a series of forty-two transpositions that do the same. We will take this as a cute exercise for the reader as given.\nThis partitions the set of all permutations into two categories:\n\neven permutations: those permutations that are reachable from the identity with an even number of transpositions\nodd permutations: those permutations that are reachable from the identity with an odd number of transpositions\n\nThe fact from the previous paragraph above makes this classification unambiguous.\nAlright, so now we have all the terminology we need to get to the argument about why the puzzle state we started with is unsolvable. We can roll up our sleeves and get started.\n\nThe first line of argument is based on this Numberphile video, and is also the one described in this 1999 American Math Monthly article by Archer. We begin with the observation that every move in the game is really a transposition behind the scenes. In particular, let’s say that we are currently in state s and we perform some move and move to state t. Let’s say the permutation associated with s was \\sigma and the permutation associated with t is \\tau. It’s not hard to see that:\n\n\\tau can be obtained from \\sigma with a single transposition.\n\nNow, note that the permutation corresponding to our target state is the following:\n\n\n\nThe permutation corresponding to our target state\n\n\nIn terms of the game state, notice that the final state has the blank tile at the bottom-right corner, just like we had at the start state. This means that in a hypothetical sequence of moves that morphs the initial game state into this solved state, we must have performed:\n\nan equal number of left and right moves; and\nan equal number of up and down moves.\n\nIf this is not the case — imagine the blank tile traveling through the board as you perform the moves — if the number of times you moved in opposite directions did not exactly cancel, it would be impossible for the blank location to be back at it’s original location.\nSo in any winning sequence, the number of moves performed must be even. This implies that the permutation corresponding to the start state, in particular, can be obtained from the identity permutation with an even number of transformations. That makes the starting permutation an even permutation.\nHowever, the permutation corresponding to the start state that we have been handed out is clearly an odd permutation: it can be obtained from the identtiy permutation by a transposition of the elements at the 14-th and 15-th positions. So, well, no dice! This shows that every solvable state that places a blank tile at the bottom-right corner must correspond to an even permutation. This does not automatically imply that all such states associated with even permutations are solvable* — it just shows that states with blank tiles at the bottom-right corner corresponding to odd permutations are firmly out of reach.\n*It does turns out that all even permutations are in fact solvable.\n\nThe second approach is based on the notion of inversions. This one is based on the Strong Induction lecture in the MITOCW course on Mathematics for Computer Science. For this proof I’ll actually switch to the 3 \\times 3 version of the puzzle because I don’t know how to extend it to the 15-puzzle the case analysis is more manageable for this version:\n\n\n\nA move in the 3 X 3 version of the puzzle\n\n\nAs we said before, the permutation associated with the starting point of the puzzle has exactly one inversion, while the permutation associated with the solved state, which is the identity permutation, has no inversions. So, when you make a move in the puzzle, what happens to the number of inversions?\nAs before, let’s say that we are currently in state s and we perform some move and move to state t. Let’s say the permutation associated with s was \\sigma and the permutation associated with t is \\tau. Let us say that a pair of elements (p,q) is affected by a move in the game if the relative order of p and q is different in the permutations \\sigma and \\tau. Now we have the following:\n\nif we perform a row move, the relative order of all elements corresponding to numbers remains the same — in particular, all affected pairs involve \\star — so the number of inversions in \\tau is exactly the same as the number of inversions in \\sigma.\nif we perform a column move, typically the element that is being moved, say p, ends up effectively jumping over two other elements, say a and b. In this case the following scenarios arise:\n\nNeither (p,a) nor (p,b) is an inversion in \\sigma.\n\n\n\nNeither (p,a) nor (p,b) is an inversion in \\sigma\n\n\n\nIn this case, both (p,a) and (p,b) emerge as new inversions in \\tau, and the total number of inversions in \\tau is two more than the total number of inversions in \\sigma.\n\nBoth (p,a) and (p,b) are inversions in \\sigma.\n\n\n\nBoth (p,a) and (p,b) are inversions in \\sigma\n\n\n\nIn this case, neither (p,a) nor (p,b) are inversions in \\tau — they both get fixed! So the total number of inversions in \\tau is two less than the total number of inversions in \\sigma.\n\nWhile (p,a) is an inversion in \\sigma, (p,b) is not.\n\n\n\nWhile (p,a) is an inversion in \\sigma, (p,b) is not\n\n\n\nIn this case, you fix some, you spoil some — so in \\tau, (p,a) is not an inversion any more, but (p,b) emerges as a new inversion; so the changes cancel and the number of inversions in \\tau is exactly the same as the number of inversions in \\sigma.\n\nWhile (p,a) is not an inversion in \\sigma, (p,b) is one.\n\n\n\nWhile (p,a) is not an inversion in \\sigma, (p,b) is one\n\n\n\nAs before, you fix some, you spoil some just the other way now — so in \\tau, (p,a) is a new inversion, but (p,b) is no longer one; so the changes cancel again and the number of inversions in \\tau is exactly the same as the number of inversions in \\sigma.\n\n\n\nThe long and short of all this is that after every move, the number of inversions either remains the same or changes by two. So no matter how many moves you perform, a state whose associated permutation has an odd number of inversions is going to remain inaccessible.\nTada!\n\nSo there we have it… I have a feeling that a little bit of language connecting transpositions and inversions will really make these proofs quite identical, at least for the 3 \\times 3 case — although I did worry that the first approach seemed to rely rather explicitly on the location of the blank tile while the second one didn’t. It is quite possible that the first one actually demonstrates more than I’m giving it credit for!\nMeanwhile, to be honest, I haven’t thought much about pushing the second line of attack to the 4 \\times 4 case — it seems already that the statement about the change in the number of inversions is no longer true and the change itself is no longer two: in particular, it could apparently go up or down by three or one instead, since the element involved in the action, p is now potentially jumping over three other elements, a, b, and c… so this, at least from an immediate consideration, doesn’t quite take us where we want to go.\nPossibly one has to work with a somewhat different invariant, maybe a notion of inversions that involve triples instead of pairs? Any comments on this would be very welcome, and I’ll have an update once I understand this a little better!"

    "title": "Building a first Django App",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In preparing for a session in a Python workshop (organised for teachers of the CBSE board who are teaching students informatics and computer science in 11th/12th grades, and who have recently had their official syllabus switch from C++ to Python), I finally got around to exploring the process of building a webapp powered by Django. I picked up the excellent Hello Web App book by Tracy Osborn for my preparation. In this post, I am going to document the process — just in case I have to do this again ☕️\nThe tutorial in Hello Web App goes over the process of building a generic “collection of things” with Django. In this tutorial, I’ll focus on a more concrete example, because it was more fun for me to build a tangible concept that I might actually use later.\nSo, I am going to build a collection of talk announcements at IIT Gandhinagar, which I intend to be displayed, on the frontend, as a slideshow. I figure that this website can then be loaded up on any internet-connected display and serve as a virtual notice board. For the frontend design, I’m going to be stealing the Webslides framework, which is a really clean HTML/CSS template for making slideshows powered by Javascript.\n\nQuickstart\nI’m going to handwave the bit about installation. Briefly, I setup Django v2.0.4 in a virtual environment, put the codebase in a git repository, and initialized a Django project via:\ndjango-admin startproject announceiitgn .\nand then a Django app via:\ndjango-admin startapp talks\nIt’s also important to add this app to settings.py, like so:\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n'talks',\n'django.contrib.admin',\n'django.contrib.auth',\n'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n'django.contrib.sessions',\n'django.contrib.messages',\n'django.contrib.staticfiles',\n]\nand also run a migration command to account for an initial setup for the databases (if you skip this step, Django will prompt you to do it anyway — as I found out by forgetting 😎):\npython [manage.py](http://manage.py/) migrate\nFinally, see your app by running the server! 🎉\npython [manage.py](http://manage.py/) runserver\nYou should see a neat little success page if you navigate to something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (the exact URL should be in your console).\nIf you are not sure how to get to this point, I’d suggest looking up an installation/setup guide such as this one from the official documentation or this one from Django Girls.\n\n\nSetting up Templates\nThe first step is to setup a basic HTML template that becomes the frontend. We go into our app directory (which, in my case, is talks) and then make a templates directory inside it, where I make a simple index.html file. Instead of using a skeleton file here, I’m going to take a deep breath and throw in the index.html from the webslides codebase. At this point I know it won’t be a pretty sight, but I’m also optimistic that I can iron it out as I go along 🤕\nI’m going to head over to urls.py and add the following import:\nfrom talks import views\nand then add the following item to urlpatterns, which I understand only vaguely at this point:\npath('',views.index,name='home'),\nWe now need to make sure that views.index actually makes sense, so switch to views.py in the talks directory and add the following:\ndef index(request):\nreturn render(request,'index.html')\nNote that render has already been imported for you from django.shortcuts. For now, I sense that this is the plumbing connecting the directive in urls.py to the meat in the templates directory. Now, navigating again to the webapp, while it’s not exactly pretty (just as predicted), but at least you can see that all the connections are working as intended:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick toggle to reveal a full-page screenshot of an unstyled webpage!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it’s time to add the static supporting files for the webslides template. I’m going to create the folder static inside the talks folder. Inside the static folder, copy over the folders css, js and images from the webslides template bundle. Now, we need to make sure that our index.html loads these supporting files from the appropriate location. This is a critical step and will completely transform the way the website is rendered if done correctly. So what we are going to do is add the following line to the top of the file:\n{% load staticfiles %}\nNext, find all instances of anything that looks like:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type='text/css' media='all' href=\"static/css/webslides.css\">\nand change it to:\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type='text/css' media='all' href=\"{% static 'css/webslides.css' %}\">\nCareful with getting the quotes and the template tags in place accurately! Also remember to attack every instance of a reference to anything the static/ directory. If you are comfortable with it, this is a near-one-shot find and replace with a regex search.`\nYou could also make this work by using relative paths (i.e., changing the paths to ../css/webslides.css), but using the Django template tags as above is more robust to changes in the directory structure — so in case your static files folder moves around, your code doesn’t have to change.\nNow, for the moment of truth, restart the server:\npython [manage.py](http://manage.py/) runserver\nand revisit your site:\n\nSo there! We’ve managed to render the webslides deck inside of our Django project — which is an awesome start already: 🎉\n\n\nStarting Clean\nOf course, we don’t quite want the index.html file to hold this particular content. I’m going to quickly pick out a slide (from the webslides demonstrations) that looks nice for displaying talk announcements, and get rid of all the original sections and just use this one. Here’s the HTML for the sections that I ended up with, populated with some sample content:\n<section>\n<div class=\"wrap\">\n<div class=\"card-30 bg-white\">\n<div class=\"flex-content\">\n<h2>Talk Title 1\n</h2>\n<p>Speaker Name & Affiliation</p>\n<p class=\"text-intro\">A brief abstract of the talk.\n</p>\n<ul class=\"description\">\n<li><strong class=\"text-label\">Date:</strong> 16 June 2018</li>\n<li>\n<strong class=\"text-label\">Time:</strong> 10:00 AM\n</li>\n<li><strong class=\"text-label\">Venue:</strong> Academic Block 1, Room 101</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<!-- end .flex-content-->\n</div>\n<!-- .end .card-50 -->\n</div>\n<!-- .end .wrap -->\n</section>\nOf course, this data would eventually be passed into the template from the database, but let’s render our site anyway and check it out once more before moving on:\n\nIt’s not hard to customize the header from index.html, but I am postponing that for a little bit later.\n\n\nTemplate Inheritance\nIt’s useful to have global-ish aspects of our template separated out into a (presumably traditionally named) base.html template, so we can make spin-offs easily. For example, when we have interviews we like to display room numbers for candidates interviewing for different disciplines on the same day, and some related general information. This page will carry the same overall structure, but we might want to use a slightly different combination of section templates. So let’s rip out the generic stuff from index.html and move it to base.html:\n{% load staticfiles %}\n...bunch of webslides header stuff...\n\n<main role=\"main\">\n  <article id=\"webslides\" class=\"vertical\">\n\n    {% block content %}\n    {% endblock content %}\n\n  </article>\n  <!-- end article -->\n</main>\n<!-- end main -->\n...bunch of webslides footer stuff...\n(Please don’t copy-paste this, work with your own webslides template if you are literally following along! I’ve not dislpayed a bunch of stuff from their index.html in the interest of space.)\nMeanwhile, your index.html now looks like this:\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n{% load staticfiles %}\n{% block content %}\n<section>\n<div class=\"wrap\">\n<div class=\"card-30 bg-white\">\n<div class=\"flex-content\">\n<h2>Talk Title 1\n</h2>\n<p>Speaker Name & Affiliation</p>\n<p class=\"text-intro\">A brief abstract of the talk.\n</p>\n<ul class=\"description\">\n<li><strong class=\"text-label\">Date:</strong> 16 June 2018</li>\n<li>\n<strong class=\"text-label\">Time:</strong> 10:00 AM\n</li>\n<li><strong class=\"text-label\">Venue:</strong> Academic Block 1, Room 101</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<!-- end .flex-content-->\n</div>\n<!-- .end .card-50 -->\n</div>\n<!-- .end .wrap -->\n</section>\n{% endblock content %}\nRemember to make sure that the line:\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\nis the very first thing in your file, and that you add:\n{% load staticfiles %}\nin case you plan to use anything in your static directory in index.html. The power of inheritance becomes a little more evident when you have other files piggybacking on base.html, but I’ll leave that to your imagination for now.\n\n\nSetting up the Database\nWe’re going to start by creating an admin user, by typing the following into the commandline:\npython manage.py createsuperuser\nThis prompts for a username, email and password — nothing out of the ordinary here. Next up is a critical point in this whole exercise, which is to setup the model, or the database schema, for the items we wanted to display. From the HTML above you might have guessed that what I want to define at this point is a talk object with the following attributes:\n\nTalk Title\nSpeaker Name\nVenue\nDate\nTime\n\nTo capture this, add the code below to models.py:\nclass Talk(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    speaker = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    description = models.TextField()\n    venue = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    date = models.DateField()\n    time = models.TimeField()\nThe field types should be self-explanatory. One type that I did not use was the SlugField, which can be handy if you want every talk to have its own page. For now, we’re keeping it simple. We then ask Django to pick up this updated database plan by running migrations as follows:\npython manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate\nWe next get the built-in Django admin interface up to speed with information about our new database, by adding the following lines to admin.py in the Talks folder:\nfrom talks.models import Talk\nclass TalkAdmin(admin.modelAdmin):\nmodel = Thing\nlist_display = ('title','speaker','description','venue','date','time')\nadmin.site.register(Talk, TalkAdmin)\nThe business with the TalkAdmin class is optional, but it lets you do nice things like prepopulate fields where relevant: for instance, if we had a slug field, we could have said something like:\nprepopulated_fields = {'slug'}: ('name',)}\njust after the list_display line above, and you could see the slug getting automatically generated in the admin interface. Speaking of admin interfaces, let’s check ours out — head over to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and login with your superuser credentials. Here’s what I see:\n\nYou should find your own data in the users table. But the interesting bits are in the Talks table, which is going to look exactly the way we modeled it above when you go to the table and click on the Add Talk button:\n\nNow let’s go ahead and add some sample data in here:\n\nI added this from the admin interface. If you like, you can setup forms for other users to add data to the database, but that’s going to be beyond the scope of our first app. For now, let’s get to tying this all together by getting the data from here to display on the frontend…\n\n\nDisplaying Dynamic Content\nIf you’ve come this far, you are now ready to pull your data into the slideshow that we setup from before. First, let’s get into views.py, pull the data from our database, and pass it on to our template. Modify the file so it looks like this:\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom talks.models import Talk\n\n#Create your views here.\n\ndef index(request):\ntalks = Talk.objects.all()\nreturn render(request, 'index.html', {\n'talks': talks,\n})\nNext, let’s head back to our index.html file, and adapt our content block:\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n{% load staticfiles %}\n{% block content %}\n{% for talk in talks %}\n<section>\n<div class=\"wrap\">\n<div class=\"card-30 bg-white\">\n<div class=\"flex-content\">\n<h2>{{ talk.title }}\n</h2>\n<p>{{ talk.speaker }}</p>\n<p class=\"text-intro\">{{ talk.description }}\n</p>\n<ul class=\"description\">\n<li><strong class=\"text-label\">Date:</strong> {{ talk.date }}</li>\n<li>\n<strong class=\"text-label\">Time:</strong> {{ talk.time }}\n</li>\n<li><strong class=\"text-label\">Venue:</strong> {{ talk.venue }}</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n    <!-- end .flex-content-->\n</div>\n<!-- .end .card-50 -->\n</div>\n<!-- .end .wrap -->\n</section>\n{% endfor %}\n{% endblock content %}\nNote that we’re now using a for loop to go over everything in talks, and replacing our static content with template tags that represent the corresponding data from the database. Django has a lot of interesting ways in which you can format your content (such as dates and times, especially, but even text strings — for instance, they can always be rendered in title case, if you like, and so on). Since the default view here is not bad, I won’t be pursuing this further — but it’s good to know that you can do cool things.\nLet’s check out our site now, to relish the sight of the slides populated with conent from our database:\n\n\n\nFiltering Dynamic Content\nLet’s say we only want to display those talks whose date is not in the past — this is a natural ask, we don’t want our virtual notice board to be cluttered with information about talks from the past (that’s more suitable for a talk archive page), and we also don’t want to have to delete talks from the database manually (two issues with this: the first is that manual is tedious, the second is that it’s nice to keep the data — quite likely the developer of the future archive page will find it useful).\nOne way to do this is to loop through all the talks in our template file, and setup a conditional for whether we display it. The main problem doing it this way is that we are doing waaaay more work than is called for: eventually this database will have thousands of talks, while you probably need to get hold of a dozen or so of them. The more appropriate solution is to setup what is called a filter when you make the database query. After some fiddling around, I finally got to this updated query in my views file:\ntalks = Talk.objects.filter(date__gte=datetime.now()).order_by('date')\nRemember to import datetime for the above to work:\nfrom datetime import datetime\nThe syntax here is almost self-explanatory: we got rid of the .all() and replaced it with a .filter() to indicate that, indeed, we don’t want all records but only those that match the filter criteria. Next, gte stands for greater than or equal to; datetime.now() refers to today’s date; while the order_by directive asks the retrieved objects to be ordered according to a particular field. You can order by this-then-that by simply adding multiple fields separated by commas, and you can reverse the order by adding a leading hyphen (or a “minus”, if you like) to the field name. Try all this out! Also: try to mess around with the query to see what happens when the query returns an empty set of records.\nGoing back to our app, we see that the one talk that was in the past (at the time of this writing) is now gone:\n\n\n\nFinishing Touches\nOne thing I didn’t touch upon was how to pass Python variables into the template. Let’s try this now, by adding a final slide that displays today’s date and a nice background image (which resides in the images/ folder under the static directory). To pull out today’s date, let’s set a variable currdate in our views file, and pass it on to our template, like so:\ndef index(request):\n    talks = Talk.objects.filter(date__gte=datetime.now()).order_by('date')\n    currdate = datetime.now()\n    return render(request, 'index.html', {\n        'talks': talks,\n        'currdate': currdate,\n})\nBack to the template, as before, I picked up a nice-looking section from the vast array of webslide’s demo pages. Carefully add this section after the forloop block ends:\n<section class=\"bg-gradient-v slide-bottom\">\n<span class=\"background light\" style=\"background-image:url('{% static 'images/campus-bg.png' %}')\"></span>\n    <div class=\"wrap\">\n        <div class=\"content-right\">\n            <h3 class=\"alignright\">{{ currdate|date }}</h3>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n<!-- .end .wrap -->\n</section>\nNote the use of {{ currdate|date }} — this displays the value of the variable currdate but formatted so that only the date is displayed (without the trailing date instruction, this would display the date and the time by default). This gives us a cool final slide:\n\nAlso remember to head back to base.html and customize the header so the social media links and the logos are relevant to your setting:\n\n\n\nBeyond the First App\nOur app was, by design, a largely view-only app. In most situations, however, your app will likely have users, so you would want features like:\n\nRegistration (possibly even single-sign ons)\nA Login Flow (optionally, also an onboarding flow)\nReset Password\nThe ability for users to view user-specific data\nThe ability for users to add/edit/delete user-specific data\n\nFor a lot of this you would need to invoke some kind of a customized form interface (different from Django’s built-in admin interface) that allows the user to interact with the database. Covering this is beyond the scope of our discussion, but if you would like to set these things up, I’d suggest continuing your journey with either this Django tutorial series, the official documentation, or Hello Web App. Have fun!"

    "text": "How\nThe last couple of decades, especially the last few years, have seen dramatic changes in how information is communicated. A lot of learning happens in online communities, for instance, question-and-answer websites like Quora and StackExchange. Thanks to folks who invest time on these platforms, expert help seems to be nearer than ever before. Specialized and snark-free communities on Discord/Slack/Telegram are enabling peer-to-peer learning at global scale. I keep hearing that Quora is not what it used to be, but as long as Thomas Cormen is an active user, I am positive it remains a valuable resource.\nBooks are beginning to be injected with exciting new technology: CodeMirror makes code interactive and runnable, while tools like PythonTutor can help with visualizing what happens behind-the-scenes when code is executed. Say what you want about JavaScript, but the interactivity that it brings to the written medium has helped make reading less passive. Some of my favorite interactive texts include Seeing Theory, Probabilistic Models of Cognition, courses on Brilliant, Mathigon, and essays from Nicky Case, Minute Labs, and others on Explorables.The name “PythonTutor” is slightly misleading, since the website also lets you visualize code snippets written in C, C++, Java, and JavaScript.\n\n\nAnd finally there are the online courses. At the time of this writing, it has been just a little over two decades since MIT’s Open Course Ware opened to the public. The early hype around MOOCs roughly coincided with my years in college and graduate school. As far as I remember, it was quite the thrill to have free-flowing access to online lectures — “taught by the best” — for several of the courses I was supposed to be doing as a part of my curriculum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this is to say that I walked into a career involving a substantial teaching component with plenty of hesitation. The delivery was/is still largely confined to classroom settings in broadcast mode. It is not entirely clear what this format has to offer over YouTube. Basic interactivity is being increasingly solved with questions built into video players. Peer learning is quite doable with WhatsApp/Slack/Discord groups and local chapter meetups. Scale in the context of assessments is somewhat addressed by peer evaluation. And then there are all the things you can do on YouTube that you can’t do with traditional lectures: find a teacher whose style resonates, find an accent you understand, replay, play at 2x, 0.5x, binge watch, don’t watch…\nSo: what’s the incentive for anyone to show up in a classroom at a fixed time, especially when said time is 8AM? This question became particularly relevant during the pandemic years: once the novelty wore off, almost nobody† showed up to lectures. If I was a student, I’d likely do the same. This remains largely an open problem in my mind, but here are some pointers that have kept me motivated about the conventional format. † Shout out to those of you accounting for the “almost”, thank you!\n\nClassroom = theatre.

For better or worse, there is a growing interest in computer science, and it will likely remain a non-trivial challenge to find an approach that is both maximally inclusive and sufficiently useful.

    "text": "YNAB (c.f. r/YNAB) (short for You Need a Budget) is a budgeting application that lets you track and manage your finances. Like most apps in this category, it provides a slick interface to enter all your transactions. YNAB is more than just cataloging transactions and tracking account balances, though. The design here revolves around (and goes beyond) what is called envelope budgeting, which basically boils down to this:\nYou can dig a little deeper into how YNAB works by looking up their four rules here. I am going to try and create an envelope budgeting system in Notion that is loosely inspired by my use of YNAB.\nTo be clear, I don’t expect to stop using YNAB, nor do I expect to replicate many of its sophisticated features. Also, there are some nice envelope budgeting systems on Notion already! For instance, you might want to check out the one here by u/sff_fan_17 or the one here by Ben Smith. These are really neat, but the only reason I’m not just duplicating one of them is that what I have in mind looks slightly different from the setups here. In particular, I would like the transactions to be dated and tied to specific accounts, and I would also like the system here to account for all the inflows and outflows in my actual system. Neither of these templates feature a hierarchy of categories either, which is something that we will attempt to do here.\nIn the first template above, I think the total income is mentioned separately, outside of the database system; and the budget covers a part of the total available income. There are explicit instructions on how to update this month-to-month, so do check this out — perhaps it works for what you might have in mind! The second template explicitly accounts for inflows, and is apparently based on this Google sheet. It does seem that the transactions are missing information about accounts and dates, which could be a little limiting if you wanted to generate a report or a dashboard for a particular period of time. Again, a great starting point, and if it resonates with your kind of setup, it’s definitely worth duplicating and playing with. Both templates are free to access and replicate.\nIncidentally, if you don’t use Notion and are hesitant to try YNAB, you could take a look at their guide to building your own budgeting template — this does not require using YNAB at all and can even be made to work pen and paper. Many people have also recreated YNAB’s core features using their own favourite tools, the most popular among which appears to be Google sheets — see, for example: Aspire Budget (c.f. r/aspirebudgeting) — I have not tried this myself, but it appears to be very feature-rich and neat overall.\nThat said, onto our own YNAB-esque budgeting template in Notion! We’re on our way to something that looks like this:\nIf you want to just skip ahead and play with the template, you can duplicate it by following this link:\nThere are three key pieces to this setup: the first is the categories (these are the labels on the envelopes, if you like), the second is the actual transactions that take take place, and the third is a list of accounts that you have (could be bank accounts, credit accounts, virtual wallets, and so on). You would want the transactions database to be linked to both categories and the accounts. More on the exact table designs below. I’m going to assume some familiarity with Notion terminology, if this is your first time with Notion then some of this may not make sense right away, but if you could just look up how Notion databases work — especially the relational aspect — then I think you’d have all you need to follow along!"

You probably want to have a small number of higher-order categories (e.g: monthly supplies, services, maintenance, health, investments, etc.) and smaller, more specific ones under these broad umbrellas (e.g, services would likely have sub-categories along the lines of internet, phone, electricity, water, etc.). You can do this by setting up a relation property to the table itself, and have it sync two-way, like so:\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2021-09-18 at 3.29.11 PM.png\n\n\n\n⚡ We want to make a database that captures the categories that our expenses fall under, and the budget that’s available for these categories.\n\nIf you want to see just the higher-order categories nicely, you can setup a gallery view with a filter for the main category to be empty, which would look like this (I’ve disabled the preview and added some icons from notion.vip):\n\n\n\nThe Gallery View\n\n\nNext, we want to specify a budget for each of these categories. We can do this directly for the lower-order categories first. Then, we can have the main category budgets calculated automatically by rolling up the budgets of the corresponding child categories and adding up their budget values. To have a clean view of the budget, you could add a formula column that just adds up the values from the direct budgets and the rollup, like so:\n\n\n\nBudget View\n\n\nYou can add two dummy properties with the text Budgeted: and Remaining: for each row, and set them to show along with the budget in the Gallery view so you get something like this:\n\n\n\nBudgeted and Remaining Labels\n\n\nThere are two natural questions at this point:\n\nHow do we know that we have budgeted what we actually have?\nHow do we know what amounts are remaining at any given point of time in the month?\n\nTo address both of these questions, we will need to flesh out the transactions database, link it to the categories and come back to this. But before that, let’s do a quick detour with an accounts database just to setup the foundation we need for the transactions database."

    "text": "Transactions\nYou might want to optionally add a memo property that lets you add a quick note or explanation for the transaction. However, given that each database entry is also a page, you could also quite flexibly add all the additional information you want to the page corresponding to any transaction. Meanwhile, you might also want to setup relations to other parts of your Notion setup if you find anything relevant — for instance, if you have a books database, or an inventory database, and so on. That said, we’re going to keep it simple here, and here’s an example transaction:\n\n\n\nAn Example Transaction\n\n\n\n⚡ Every transaction has the following: an amount, a payee, the account to which the amount was debited or credited to, the date the transaction happened, and and the expense category that the transaction belonged to. We set these up as columns with the appropriate properties, with the accounts and categories being relational links.\n\nYou’ll notice that I’ve linked to both the child and the parent category for this transaction. It would be nice if the parent category was pulled up automatically — and this is possible with a formula, but as far as I know the formula will not actually link the transaction to the main category. So for now, we assign both categories manually. 🤷‍♀️\nOne quick thing to do now is to go back to the Accounts database and add a rollup property that takes on the sum of the amounts property from the related transactions table, and once done, the balances show up nicely in the gallery view:\n\n\n\n\n\nRollup sum of amounts in accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery view of balances\n\n\n\n\nNow we go back to our categories database and rename the relational column to transactions and add a rollup that collects all expenses from the transactions that happened in a particular category, so this is what it looks like:\n\n\n\nCategory view\n\n\nNow add a formula column available that simply adds up the budget and the expense columns so you can find out how much of your budget is still available for use. My formula looks like this:\nprop(\"Final Budget\") + prop(\"Expenses\")\nNote that it might feel more natural to subtract expenses, but my expenses are already negative amount transactions, so I just need to bundle it all together.\n\n\n\nCategory View\n\n\nJust for fun, you could also add a status column that visually indicates how much of your budget you have left. The progress-bar style of the status property here is inspired by this guide, and the formula I used requires a couple of auxiliary columns that calculate the percentage and determine if a half-star should be used or not based on the value of the decimal part. It also first checks that the available balance is in fact positive, if not, it’s going to display a suitably scary warning emoji. I won’t bore you with the specifics here, but you can find the formula in the template that I’ve linked to at the end of this post.\nSo now we are at a point where the remaining amounts are calculated based on the transactions. However, we still have to think about how to link the budgeted amounts to the actual money available. In fact, speaking of money available, I haven’t really touched upon how to handle transactions that are not expenses; i.e, transactions with a positive amount value and that reflect money coming into the system as opposed to leaving it. These are, of course, just regular transactions — but what category do we assign them to? All the ones we have so far really capture spends, not inflows…\nSo, it turns out that YNAB would take all this money and automatically categorize it as unassigned, or to be budgeted. We can mimic this by creating a special category called to be assigned, and have all income-type transactions categorized as such. Typically this would be transactions corresponding to a salary, client payments, refunds, credit from interest, and so forth.\n\n\n\nThe TBA Category\n\n\nNotice that the so-called expenses1 that are now accumulating in this category is actually the total amount of money that came into the system. Incidentally, if you were to just look at the sum of the balance column in the accounts database, that’s the net amount of money in the system at any given point of time.1 Remember that the expenses column just rolled up the transaction amounts in a particular category.\n\n\n\n\nAccounts View\n\n\n\n⚡ Note that transactions that just move money within your accounts, like a credit card payment, don’t need any explicit expense categories.\n\nYou also don’t need to budget separately for credit card payments, because your credit card bill is composed of transactions that were already budgeted for! Even if they were items corresponding to, say, credit card fees, you probably categorized them under Services, for example. So we won’t have a separate budget for credit card bill payments (although I should mention that YNAB does this explicitly and handles it automatically).\nAlright, so it seems like we are nearly there, except that our current situation is the following:\n\nThe amount the to be assigned category is a true reflection of incoming funds.\nThe amounts that we added to our category budgets were setup manually and generally divorced from the reality in the transactions database.\n\n\n⚡ To fix this, we need some way to move funds from the to be assigned category to the other ones.\n\nFor example, let’s say I want to budget 750 for ebooks this month. I could do this by adding a dummy transaction that debits an amount of 750 to the to be assigned category and credits it to the ebooks category. What this means is that when we roll up the amounts from all transactions, we directly obtain the amount remaining for us to spend!\nSo for the very first month, when we have a clean slate, we just have a bunch of such transactions — these won’t have any explicit account associated with them because they aren’t real transactions; and in fact you can always filter your transactions table so that you only see the meaningful ones by setting the condition that the accounts column should be non-empty.\nMeanwhile, here is how we do the budgets for our categories all over again, this time via these virtual transactions:\n\n\n\nBudget Overview\n\n\nIf you go to the to be assigned row in the categories table and look at the rollup value in the expenses column, then you’ll see that it corresponds to either the amount of money that’s still assigned (these are dollars — or in my case, rupees — that don’t have a job yet), or, in case you happen to have overshot the budget, the amount by which you are falling short. In the former situation, the available amount will be a positive number, while in the latter, it’ll be negative.\n\n\n\nTo Be Assigned\n\n\nIdeally, we just want this number to be zero, indicating that everything has been assigned appropriately. To achieve this:\n\nIf your budgets have collectively overshot the amount of money available, re-adjust them them — specifically, reduce some of the amounts — so that this is no longer the case. Of course, I am saying this from a theoretical standpoint; if your situation is that you have real expenses that you don’t have real money for, then you would want to plan for this by bringing the differential amount of money into the system via a loan, and then planning the repayment by budgeting for it as well. Dealing with debt is beyond the scope of this discussion, but I think the YNAB blog, book, and videos go into this at length.\nIf you have money left over, you could either add it to your budgets, giving yourself some extra wiggle room; but I prefer to budget for fixed amounts generally, so in this situation I’ll just add this amount to something I call a Miscellaneous or Scratchpad category. It’s something you can borrow from if you fall short later, it has no particular semantics. Some people like to sweep off any excess money into deposit accounts, and if you do this, then you might want to create those accounts in the system and enter those transactions to get rid of this positive balance.\n\nAt the end of this, you are in a situation where all money is nice and assigned. Since we started off by specifying budgets manually, we should go back and fix some formulas in our database of categories. In particular, here’s what I did to simplify things:\n\nRemove the Available column (previously this was the difference of the manually set budget and the rolled up expenses).\nRename Expenses to Available, since the rollup now just reflects what’s truly available.\n\nI’m going to leave the manually added budgets in — although we won’t use them to calculate what’s truly available any more, they will help us plan our budgets going forward.\nEverything so far should make sense for an initial setup, but what do we do when we have new incoming transactions that need to be assigned to categories? I generally like to do the budgeting exercise once at the start of every month, so any intermediate positive transactions into the system will either remain in the To be assigned category, or if you are OCD about wanting that that category to be set to zero always, you can always push this number out into your scratchpad.\nAt the start of the month (this could be another day and a different frequency; but I do recommend being consistent for simplicity), we need to refuel the categories with the funds available. There are two kinds of things that could happen here, broadly speaking:\n\nFor categories that represent a plan to save up to something, like a vacation, or a category where you feel like you want to have a certain amount of money set aside every month irrespective of how much you spent in the last month, you just want to push budget amount of money into that category via the virtual transactions we discussed earlier.\nFor other categories, which I like to think of as those having rolling budgets, you want to only assign the difference between what was budgeted and what was spent… and hopefully this is a non-negative quantity!\n\nYou could setup a checkbox to indicate which categories have rolling budgets and which ones do not, and then this formula:\nprop(\"IsRolling?\") ? (prop(\"Budget\") - prop(\"Available\")) : prop(\"Budget\")\nwill tell you how much you should budget for next month.\n\n\n\nIn this example, Ebooks are not a rolling category, so even though I need only 628.95 to meet the original budget, I’ll still set aside the full 750, and the amount that will be available will be 871.05. On the other hand, Phone is a rolling category, and presumably my phone-related expenses in the current month added up to 420, so the recommendation is to budget 420 next time so you’ll still have 500 available total.\n\n\nIn this example, Ebooks are not a rolling category, so even though I need only 628.95 to meet the original budget, I’ll still set aside the full 750, and the amount that will be available will be 871.05.

However, it’s not too bad, especially if you enter it right away. You could also potentially automate this via API integrations, or enter your transactions in your regular app and export them as a CSV and import them into the Notion system once every so often.\n\n\n\nTransaction Table\n\n\nThe budgeting bit is going to be a little more work, especially if you work with a gazillion categories. The formulas will guide to you what needs to be done, but those virtual transactions still need to be added manually. On YNAB, you can do what I described above (adding the deficit to rollup categories and the originally intended budgets to the others) in one click — and there are other options too, for example, you may have moved to a new location and you’re still getting the hang of what you’ll need to set aside for groceries, so YNAB will offer to budget what you spent last month, or your average expenses from the last six months, and so on. Here, since you are assigning things manually, you can definitely tweak as you go; the next month column is just a suggestion.\nYou can probably prepare a CSV file with the default budget amounts and just merge this in at the start of every month if your expenses are super predictable, and just adjust the entries that need adjusting. This will save you some time, but remember that the categories still need to be linked to manually. It’s not too bad for something that happens once a month and that will hopefully bring you some sense of control and awareness 😇\nPerhaps also try and not have a gazillion categories and sub-categories, at least to begin with — it helps to keep things simple, especially when starting out."

This is just to say that this setup here may be both limiting and feeing because of how much of the setup is manually done. At least that’s my optimistic view right now 😀\nFinally, YNAB also has an option to reconcile accounts, which is when you declare that the numbers in YNAB match the book balance according to your bank or credit card agency. This is a neat little thing that I like to check off every so often. Here, I suppose you could just glance through the balances on the Accounts database (remember the gallery view from earlier?), but it won’t have the same song-and-dance-y feeling — but maybe this could be a recurring task that you can check off, and hopefully that will feel good 😅\nSo that’s about it!

    "text": "This is the text of a short speech I gave at the farewell event for Prof. Sudhir Jain as he left IITGN for BHU.\n\n\n\nProf. Jain at the farewell event held on the 3rd January, 2022.\n\n\nYou can find out more about Prof. Jain’s own take on the cultural foundations of IIT Gandhinagar here, where he is in conversation with Achal Mehra.\n\n\nCanadian astronaut Chris Hadfield has said that leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It’s about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others’ success, and then standing back and letting them shine. If that sounds familiar, I think it’s because we have lived this experience at IIT Gandhinagar, thanks to Prof. Jain.\nOur guiding principles have been often unconventional — whether it’s about having students first, or choosing to trade short-term gains for the long-term vision. They have sometimes led to decisions that would seem quite inexplicable to anyone who did not have the context. Some of you might remember how early we started the undergraduate program in Computer Science, for example. Ok, so for the record, we started it quite late, at least according to conventional wisdom.\nCrucially, these core values have always been articulated in collaboration, with inputs from all stakeholders, which is what enables our shared conviction in them once they have been established.\nProf. Jain’s vision for IIT Gandhinagar is as precise as it’s bold – he knew exactly what needed to be done for this place to emerge as a model institution. He had recently shared with us his roadmap for IITGN from a dozen years ago. This roadmap committed not to vague ideas but concrete goals, complete with numbers for metrics that are fraught with uncertainty. It’s absolutely stunning how everything panned out almost exactly according to plan!\nOur narrative has many collaborators, including our students, faculty, and staff. And while some of us are relatively inexperienced, Prof. Jain’s trust in everyone has been hugely empowering. It manifests in many concrete ways – starting from wanting for students to be recognized as adults, to turning young colleagues into decision-makers… and this is why all of us have a deep sense of ownership for IITGN.\nAn environment that gives all of us the freedom to experiment and the leeway to fail is extremely enabling. This has led to a wide spectrum of wins, many that are quantifiable and others that are less tangible. If you want to get a sense of how good the times have been, just look around – the sheer beauty and the attention to detail that the campus embodies is an excellent symbolism for the inclusive, thoughtful, and innovative leadership that we have experienced. When it comes to how far we have come, I could go on… pretty much forever, so I’ll defer you to the website for more details.\nIt is impossible to imagine IITGN without you. This is your brainchild through and through. Despite knowing that you’ll not be distancing in spirit, we will miss having you nurture the institution in the hands-on manner that you have always done. Your passion for the IITGN mission – of being a breakout university while operating within the limitations and strengths of the IIT system – is contagious. I am sure you plan to double down on this even though you may have a few distractions going forward.\nI recently watched Maanaadu, a movie based on the idea of a time loop. In such stories, the plot involves the protagonist experiencing the same day over and over again, and their goal, typically, is to find an exit. If there is one day that we could put into a time loop, it would be today, and there would be no need to get out of it.\nIn the meantime – on behalf of all of us, thank you.\nThank you for your commitment, trust, and friendship; for listening patiently, for leading tirelessly, and for fighting the good fight through tough times, and for the good times through tough fights – ok, I’m going to be out of time, here, clearly – so let me just say, thank you for everything."

    "title": "How Expensive Can Homework Help Be?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is based on an expository explanation of iterative compression that I attempted at the Institute Seminar Week in 2010, at IMSc.\n\n\n\nTapesh has been struggling lately with the dire task of undergraduate homework. He has been asked to find a vertex cover on 23 vertices - not one more - in a graph that has a thousand vertices. Being the straightforward boy that he is, Tapesh considers writing a program that will try its luck on every possible subset of 23 vertices.\nHe then heads over to Wolfram Alpha to check how long it will be before he’s done examining all the {1000 \\choose 23} possibilities, assuming (rather liberally) that he has at his disposal a computer that can perform 10^{24} operations per second.\nIt turns out that he, and more critically, his professor, would be in for a long, long wait. The algorithm would need time proportional to the age of the universe many times over, and this is decidedly depressing, particularly when one’s expected lifespan appears to be determined by the deadline for turning in homework.\nTapesh now appeals to his very clever cousin, Prodosh, for help.\nProdosh borrows the monstrous graph, and in short order, points out a vertex cover on 24 vertices, using powers evidently beyond what processors with 10^{24} FLOPS can do. Tapesh is thrilled, however…\n“I need to get one with 23, the assignment says not one more —”\n“Time for a smoke,” Prodosh yawns, and then delves into a distracted, pensive mood, with no signs of immediate return.\nTapesh is torn, but he decides to (gulp) show whatever he has so far - after all, it is progress!\nPredictably, Professor Maganlal displays no signs of being impressed, but he grudgingly admits that Tapesh’s solution (which we will call T) is not very far from the correct answer, and points out those vertices in T that happen to partake in the solution that was sought.\nTapesh is back to the drawing board, but with the distinct feeling that he is now armed with enough information to crack the code himself.\nHis solution T is now partitioned into the good part (T_G), that is, all the vertices of T that belong to X, and the bad part (T_B), which are all the vertices that do not belong to X.\n“Aha.”\nNecessarily, all the neighbors of the bad part must belong to X!\nHe checks, and sure enough, the number of vertices in T_G and N(T_B) is an exact, resounding 23. Also, very fortunately, there are no edges in T_B, so he has no trouble swapping T_B for N(T_B) to get to the newer and smaller vertex cover.\nMission accomplished!\nNow more confident, Tapesh wonders if he could have arrived at X all on his own. Indeed, what would he have done without Pradosh’s help? And without Professor Maganlal giving him that partition?\nCome to think of it, the second question has an easy answer. Tapesh would just try all possible partitions of the solution that Pradosh had given him. He would only have to disregard the partitions that didn’t work… and sooner or later, he would hit the one that his Professor so graciously suggested. This would mean examining 2^{24} subsets, a matter of a split second for a personal computer.\nBut - can he replicate Pradosh’s magic on his own?\nTapesh is up into the middle of the night waiting for the brainwave that will make him completely self-dependent, at least in the broad context of finding small vertex covers in large graphs.\nHe is still impressed that he has just found a general scheme for taking a vertex cover of size 24 and bringing it down to 23. Wanting to make the most of the only trick he knew, he wondered if he could use it more than once.\nSo he looked at the 1,000-vertex monstrosity and contemplated the possibility of working with a manageable chunk first. What if he selected an easy subgraph H for isolated consideration? Surely, if G has a vertex cover of 23 vertices, H has one too. So all he would need is to find a vertex cover on 24 vertices, and he already knew how to squish it to one of size 23.\nWhat was the easiest chunk that he could work with? One on which finding a vertex cover of size 24 wasn’t hard?\nBut of course, a subgraph on 24 vertices would be really easy to deal with!\nThe entire graph H would serve as its own vertex cover, would be of size 24 — it couldn’t get easier than that.\nSo Tapesh starts by selecting the first 24 vertices that he can find, and applies his squishing strategy to find a vertex cover on 23 vertices.\nWhat now?\nHe gives the remaining 976 vertices a hesitant look.\nMaybe it was time to grow H to include some more vertices? If Tapesh could get H to eventually morph into being all of G, he would be done!\nBut if he added a whole bunch of new vertices, he would need to do something about finding a vertex cover of size 24 in the bigger H to make progress… but that sounded like work :(\nMaybe, maybe just let in one more vertex into the precious subgraph H? Indeed, there is enough room in the vertex cover of size 23 for one more vertex. So H would grow by a single vertex, and so would the vertex cover - and then Tapesh could squish it again!\nAnd there is no stopping Tapesh from repeating this 975 times more, and each time, the reincarnated H would be one larger than before, and every time he would beat down the vertex cover to one of size 23, till he got to the end.\nBut, Tapesh wonders sleepily, wouldn’t this take awfully long?\nThe squishing was quick, and now it has to be done 977 times altogether… and even at the lesiurely pace of doing one iteration in one second, you would need less than half an hour before you finished.\nNot too shabby — certainly no waiting for universes to come and go!\nIn general, the problem of finding a vertex cover of size k in a graph on n vertices vertices can be done in time:\nO((n-k) \\cdot 2^{k+1})\nfollowing the recipe in this story.\nIf this algorithm aborts, unable to find a vertex cover of size k, it is because a subgraph did not have a vertex cover of size k. Of course, this also means that the entire graph does not have a vertex cover of size k either, so the process makes sense.\nIt is important to note that not every problem is designed to fit this bill, for instance, if the next homework assignment demands a vertex cover that is also connected, the iteration procedure, as it stands, might not be accurate when it reports a negative answer.\nThe next assignment, therefore, potentially leads to a more demanding adventure."

A few days after I joined, I met Achal Mehra, who introduced me to Connections: a four-page newsletter that went places every quarter. In my mind, that conversation kickstarted my collaboration with what everyone fondly calls “comms”. Seven years later, I’m here to report that the journey has been fun and fulfilling in equal measure.\nThrough this post, I’d like to introduce you to the comms team: if you have been to IITGN for an event, read about us in the press, have recieved a newsletter from us, visited our website, or followed our social media: these are the folks who work behind the scenes on these fronts. Being a part of this gang has been a huge inspiration: everyone is talented but always willing to learn; their hard work is driven by a sense of ownership; and there’s plenty of wit to help beat the heat :)\nHere’s collection of some randomly chosen memories: my hat-tip to a stellar team."

We get dozens of emails every day announcing events of varying scales, updates of various kinds.\nAnticipating that the volume would only get worse, we devised a system for manually cataloging every bit of news in a bunch of Airtable bases. The long-term vision was that the Airtable API exposes this data to anyone who needs it: the web team could draw from it and filter appropriately to display upcoming events, an archival team could write a report generating app that used this as the backend, and so forth. We even had a web app developed by a team of undergraduates that pulled data from these bases to show off upcoming events on a big screen.\nDhara now manually curates information from these databases and runs a weekly internal newsletter collating what’s happened and what’s coming up at IITGN: this has been a major value addition for many. She also serves up the raw data needed for our public quarterly newsletter and annual reports based on this system, which saves everyone a lot of time.

    "text": "My tool of choice for bulk file-renaming has become1 Massren:1 As opposed to, say, GUI clients.\n\nMassren is a command line tool that can be used to rename multiple files using your own text editor. Multiple-rename tools are usually difficult to use from the command line since any regular e xpression needs to be escaped, and each tool uses its own syntax and flavor of regex. The advantage of massren is that you are using the text editor you use every day, and so you can use all the features you are already used to.\n\nSimply navigate to the directory in which your files are and invoke massren. You can easily set it up to use your favorite text editor, so for example, I have mine configured to use VSCode:\nmassren --config editor code\nIf you have a text editor you are comfortable with, then this can lead to all kinds of interesting possibilities, especially when combined with regular expression search.\n\n\n\nUsing Massren, VS Code, and regex for bulk file renaming.\n\n\nThis workflow is especially convenient in combination with an Alfred wokflow to open the current Finder directory in the terminal, such as this one."

    "text": "Dog Bunny: A Cute Puzzle\nConrad Barski (@lisperati)’s latest, Dog Bunny Puzzle, had jumped to #1 on HN. The puzzle presents the following somewhat minimalist interface:\n\n\n\nThe Dogs Bunny Puzzle\n\n\nIf you haven’t played it yet, you might want to go ahead and give it a shot first. Most people figured out the mechanics without any explicit instructions. A couple of things that may not be immediately clear, but typically discovered quickly within a few moves:\n\nThe edges are labeled with conditions, and can be used only if all of the said conditions are met.\nThe bunny or dog icons may sometimes cover up what kind of location they are at. You can drag them away to find out!\nMultiple animals can occupy the same spot at a time.\nIt is possible to get into a dead end, a situation from where no legal moves are possible. In the verison of the game that is available at the time of this writing, the game offers no sign that you might be in this situation. This may however change.\n\nAfter winging it on the puzzle, several questions seemed natural:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the smallest number of moves to win?\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently 26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you write a program to find a solution?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes (Python) and yes (Picat).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan a script generate more of these puzzles?\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed:\n\n\nFor those paying attention, yes I am two days late :(FYI, I also have a program now that can create an infinite number of these puzzles at differing difficultyHow would you rate the puzzle I posted today?\n\n— Conrad Barski (@lisperati) September 17, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there connections with other well-known puzzles?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy yes, check out the Wolf puzzle (as pointed out by @RianNeogi) and this Numberphile video about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the problem NP-complete?\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you ask, I am not the only one who’s asking!\n\n\n\nSo the last question may strike you as a bit left-field, but that’s what I’m going to ramble about for the rest of this post :) It turns out that the answer is in the affirmative, and here is a lovely reduction by @lokshtanov showing as much.\n\n\nThe Reduction\nLet’s just set up the game as a computational problem just to be sure that we agree on the abstraction. In fact, we’ll be working with a simpler version that we will call BunnyCarrot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBunnyCarrot\n\n\n\nIn the BunnyCarrot problem, the input is a simple undirected graph G = (V,E), subsets B and C of V indicating the initial positions of bunnies and carrots, and a (possibly empty) instruction r_e for every e \\in E, which is a collection of conditions, at least one† of which must be true for the edge e to be “active”.\nThe question is if there is a sequence of movements of bunnies along active edges such that at the end of the sequence, every bunny is located at one of the vertices from C.\n† In the original version of the problem, we need all conditions associated with an edge to be satisfied, not at least one. The construction that we will describe can be easily adapted to this setting as well, but is simpler to describe for this variant :)\n\n\nWe are going to show that BunnyCarrot is NP-complete by reducing from 3SAT. So let \\phi := \\{C_1, \\ldots, C_m\\} be a collection of m 3SAT clauses over variables \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}. The reduced instance of BunnyCarrot corresponding to \\phi looks like this:\n\n\n\nA cartoon sketch of the reduced instance of BunnyCarrot from 3SAT.\n\n\nWhat we have here is the following in terms of the structure of graph:\n\na path X on m+2 vertices, with the left most vertex in B and the rightmost one in C;\na pair of vertices (u_i,v_i) for every i \\in [n], and an edge between them, where all the u_i’s are in B’ — the vertex u_i represents the literal x_i while the vertex v_i represents the literal \\overline{x_i};\na pair of vertices p and q in C, with p adjacent to all u_i’s and q adjacent to all v_i’s.\n\nNow here be the instructions associated with the edges:\n\nthe edge to the \\ell-th vertex on X is active only if there is a bunny on at least one of the literals present in the clause C_{\\ell-1};\nthe edges between u_i and v_i are active only when there is a bunny on the leftmost vertex of X; and\nfinally, the edges incident on p and q are active only when there is a bunny on the rightmost vertex of X.\n\n\n\nThe Forward Direction\nWe first claim that we can “win” this game if \\phi has a satisfying assignment. Indeed, let \\tau: \\{x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\} be a truth assignment that satisfies all the clauses of \\phi. Then:\n\nIf \\tau(x_i) = 0, move the bunny on u_i to v_i.\nMove the bunny on the leftmost vertex of the path X to the rightmost vertex: note that all edges are active because \\tau is a satisfying assignment.\nMove all bunnies on u_i’s to p and those on v_i’s to q.\n\n\n\nThe Backward Direction\nNow suppose there is a winning sequence of moves \\sigma. We will show that we can extract from this sequence a satisfying assignment for \\phi, which will firmly establish the equivalence of the generated instance of BunnyCarrot with the OG hard instance \\phi.\nNote that to begin with, all the blue edges are inactive. Now, in the sequence \\sigma, let us say that a step is key if it involves a bunny moving along the first edge of the path X and critical if it involves a bunny moving along the last edge of the path X.\nSuppose the \\ell-th step is the first critical step in \\sigma. Further, suppose that the t-th step is the last key step to occur before the \\ell-th step. Notice that there must be at least one key step before a critical step — we must begin before we can end :)\nNow, for all steps after the t-th step and before the \\ell-th step, note that edges incident to u_i and v_i are inactive for all i \\in [n]. This implies that every step between the t-th and \\ell-th steps involves a bunny moving along X, and in particular, every edge in X is crossed at least once in this phase of the game.\nLet us note the positions of the bunnies who are on the u_i’s and v_i’s after the t-th step is executed. Observe that this naturally translates to an assignment on the variables as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\tau(x_i) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n      1 & \\text{if } u_i \\in B,\\\\\n      0 & \\text{if } v_i \\in B.\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nWe argue that \\tau must in fact be a satisfying assignment.\nAssume to the contrary: suppose some clause C_k is, in fact, not satisfied by \\tau.\nThen, we claim that the edge connecting the k-th and (k+1)-th vertices is not active.\nAs an example, suppose C_k = \\{x_1,x_2,\\overline{x_3}\\}. Since \\tau does not satisfy C_k, it must be the case that:\n\n\\tau(x_1) = 0 — and hence there is a bunny on v_1;\n\\tau(x_2) = 0 — and hence there is a bunny on v_2;\n\\tau(x_3) = 1 — and hence there is a bunny on u_3.\n\nHowever, the condition for the edge to the (k+1)-th vertex on X to be active is simply that there is a bunny present on at least one of the literals present in the clause C_{k}, i.e, one of u_1, u_2 or v_3. However, because of the structure of the graph, and the fact that all edges incident on p and q are inactive at all times before the first critical step, observe that:\n\nIf there is a bunny on v_1, there is no bunny on u_1.\nIf there is a bunny on v_2, there is no bunny on u_2.\nIf there is a bunny on u_3, there is no bunny on v_3.\n\nBy our assumption that \\tau falsifies C_k, all the premises above are true! So there is an edge on the path X that is not active between the t-th and \\ell-th steps, which violates our understanding that every edge was crossed between these steps. This is a contradiction, and hence \\tau must indeed be a satisfying assignment.\nI’ll just remark here that this construction can be modified so that every vertex in the graph has constant degree, and there is only one vertex in C. It can also be modified to change the “or” condition on the edges to an “and”, by simply separating the conditions out along multiedges.\n\n\nFood for thought\nHere are some more questions :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the complexity of this game when the underlying graph has some simple structure (e.g, a tree)?\nDoes the problem get harder if we introduce attacking entities like wolves?\nCan we come up with an algorithm that runs in polynomial time on instances where there is a valid winning sequence of constant length?\nIs the problem hard even for a constant number of bunnies?\n\n\n\n\nPS. Here’s a sketch of a slighty different reduction from vertex cover. Thanks again to Daniel for sharing the reduction described here! Comments welcome here, or continue the conversation on Twitter!"

    "text": "Here’s a list of 50 things1 (with occasional additional context) that I install whenever I’m setting up macOS from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia Setapp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBartender\nKeeps the menubar clean. Very handy!\nBetter Touch Tool\nI really need to leverage this a lot more, but even simple actions like swipe down with three fingers to close a tab, or tip-tap right left to move between tabs is pretty awesome already. Also use four-finger double tap to make the mouse pointer larger when it’s lost between screens… I’d guess this app can probably subsume a lot of the functionality offered by apps like Keyboard Maestro and Alfred.\niStat Menus\nGood-looking stats in the menubar 👍️\nYoink\nHas to be one of the best shelf apps out there. I know that there are a bunch of others in this space right now (👀, Filepane), however I have been using Yoink for so long that I haven’t considered switching. My common use-cases:\n\nAlfred actions to send-to-Yoink\nUsing Yoink to stash away screenshots before the floating image disappears\nA KM shortcut that can send any Finder item to Yoink\n\nCleanMyMac\nMostly to keep track of file sizes via the Space Lens.\nAlternative if using only this feature: Daisy Disk\nDefault Folder X\nUse this all the time to stash away stuff where it belongs to keep Downloads clutter-free. Also the Alfred DFX collection is handy for finding recent items even if not 100% reliable.\nTiming\nUse this to supplement manual time-tracking. Do not use it to its full potential at all, I think a little investment with setting up the right projects etc. can go a long way.\nDropzone\nI mostly use this as a longer-term stash than Yoink. I think there are some very nice possibilities here, but the only things I’ve done with it so far include:\n\nuploading images online\nopening a finder path in a terminal (superseded by an Alfred shortcut)\ndropping files in select locations\nURL shortening\n\nPermute\nHandy for all kinds of (bulk) file conversions.\nText Sniper\nImpressive OCR “from anywhere”.\nSwish\nIntuitive gestures for window management. Pretty confident all this can be done in Better Touch Tool (above), but the actions are inspiring, and I’m lazy, so yeah, this is explicitly installed.\nDownie\nUse this for downloading videos from Youtube for offline viewing/listening. Fairly robust.\nIconJar\nIcon collection, enough said. 🎁\nSip\nHandy 🎨 color picker.\nWorld Clock Pro\nVisually appealing world-clock, nice for scheduling stuff across timezones, great screensaver option as well.\nDash\nDocumentation lookup, handy that it works inside VS Code (via an extension).\nMindNode\nLovely mindmaps.\nPDFPen\nAlthough I mostly use Preview, PDFPen is useful for quickly rearranging and removing pages. Not sure about the several other features claimed, I find that it sadly crashes more often than not, so not my default application.\nTextSoap\nOccasional use, but very useful when I do need it for some pesky hidden-unicode-character-removal exercise.\nMathKey\nNiche app - on the rare occasion that I have a complicated LaTeX formula to write, I can write it in the iOS version of this app and receive it on the Mac (I don’t think the desktop app is even necessary for this; the iOS purchase can be bypassed by using the Mac app via Sidecar, but this is where I discovered the app so it makes the list).\nMarked\nPowerful previews for Markdown documents. Lots of interesting export features.\nChronoSync Express\nThis helps with keeping certain folders in sync, and setting up some backup schedules. Nothing that can’t be done with a few scripts (?) and/or Time Machine, but I did end up setting (and forgetting) a few things in here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotion\nI’m (admittedly* experimentally) using Notion as my primary PKM tool, and it’s also where I am keeping most of my public-facing content (including this blog). My usage of Notion is gradually expanding in scope to include time/task/finance tracking as well. Too slow.\n*and also admittedly yet-again, after a fairly committed detour through Obsidian, Craft, and VSCode extensions for several months…\nBibdesk\nFairly robust reference management that has most of what I need — priority features include speed, reliability, flexibility in generating citekeys and decent auto-filing of papers added to the database (popular free and paid alternatives that I’ve tried briefly: Zotero, Mendeley, Setne, Papers, Readcube, JabRef, Bookends).\nIncidentally, if you are into Obsidian and Zotero, you might enjoy this video.\nMacTeX\nLaTeX and related tools, including TeX-friendly IDEs and reference management tools.\nXcode Tools, pandoc, and homebrew\nNeed these to work with code.\nContexts\nThe app that I miss the first when on a machine that doesn’t have it, next to Alfred. Makes window switching much more search and keyboard-driven.\nAlfred\nApart from using it as a launcher (even for files), I almost use Alfred as a Finder replacement. Here are some of my favorite Alfred workflows:\n\nMenubar Search\nSimple Folder Search (only search for folders)\nCase Switch (combined with send-text-to-Alfred below, this can be quite nifty)\nSymbols Search (unicode goodness)\nSend to Yoink\nQuit Applications\nSend text to Alfred (double-tap the option key)\nColor\nCurrency Exchanges\n\nKeyboard Maestro\nReally elaborate shortcut/automation app. I’ve only scratched the surface with my use cases, but one of the things I really dig about my setup is simulating keypress sequences.\nThe way I do this is to activate a macro group for one action with one keyboard shortcut (e.g, CMD + ;) and then have all macros within that have one-letter or one-letter + one-modifier triggers - basically very easy triggers. This way, I only have to remember a bunch of high-level shortcuts for things in various categories, and from there it’s just a letter (and the same letter can be overloaded in different contexts).\nAs a concrete example, I have a macro group called launchers, and a shortcut within that for launching chrome. So something like CMD+L followed by c would launch Chrome. Although I have to confess that I mostly launch stuff through Alfred still (at the cost of one or two extra keystrokes).\nKeypress-sequence-triggers are native to Better Touch Tool and since BTT supports AppleScript, you could also run KM macros from BTT. I haven’t quite tried this yet.\nMore advice on this here.\nTypinator\nFast snippet expansion - faster than TextExpander (one of the main competitors in this space) in my experience. Recent updates have some rad features, which of course I’m yet to explore and exploit!\n1Password\nReasonably user-friendly and robust password management. Syncs to iOS, but I haven’t managed to leverage it so much on iOS. 1Password is ideal for storing confidential information nicely (IDs, bank stuff, and the like) - if used only for passwords I suppose the Keychain does a good job too.\nFantastical and Calendar\nFantastical is a nice (but expensive!) calendar app, mostly use it because of the calendar sets feature that keeps my time blocking calendars separate from the official one that is public within the organization. Of late, I especially like the way you can join online meetings from the notifications.\nHaving said that, I realized that much of what I was doing with Fantastical was overkill and I’ve switched to the default calendar app for now, and it’s one paid subscription less2 to have.\nOk so I am back on Fantastical, because I am kind of\nVS Code\nThis is where I am supposed to be spending most of my time, perhaps next only to Craft/Notion. A few things from my VSCode workflow:\n\nUse different themes for different file types (I mostly dabble in LaTeX, C++, Python, JavaScript, and Markdown)\nLittle utility extensions save a lot of time: e.g, sort lines, increment value at cursor, file management, etc.\nMulticursor-powered find and replace is amazing.\nWorkspaces are handy and I usually launch them from Alfred.\n\nHook\nLooks very promising for cross-linking stuff across apps that have a common context (say, a project). I really need to explore this more!\nStream Deck (best with accompanying hardware)\nParticularly useful for switching OBS scenes although I use it less than I thought I would!\nIn particular, I want to explore their VSCode and KM integrations.\nIf without the physical device, Streamdeck does have a nice iOS app that simulates the hardware, but the pricing is based on a subscription model.\nGoogle Chrome\nI can’t make up my mind between Chrome/FF/Brave/Safari. I mostly switch between Chrome and Safari, with a mild preference for Chrome because of it’s more comprehensive extensions space, but I often end up with Safari as default for speed and privacy.\nReadkit\nUse this for RSS, although I’ve mostly migrated away to DEVONthink. Still looking for a nice stand-alone RSS reader though, Readkit doesn’t always render everything the way I expect, sadly.\nOBS\nFor recording and live-streaming videos. Also useful as a virtual camera for meeting apps.\nScreenflow and Camtasia\nFor recording videos, lots of features, still finding my way around them.\nSlack and Discord\nOnline communities. I sometimes wish there was a native app for discourse too (is there?)\nKeynote\nPresentations - main alternative: Beamer + LaTeX + pgf/TikZ; or one of the JS-based slide generator tools from Markdown files (I did use react.js for one entire term).\nDEVONthink\nUse this fairly minimally (especially relative to the possibilities). At the moment DT indexes a couple of key finder folders and pulls in information from a lot of RSS feeds and even Twitter accounts. I try to review the stuff that automatically piles up in DT regularly, but — at the moment — it’s mostly a dumping ground and… messy.\nMicrosoft Teams, Skype, and Zoom\nUse this for classes and online meetings.\nOffice suite: Word/Powerpoint/Excel\nUse it only to open files I receive.\nFruitjuice\nUseful battery health monitoring, discovered the app from a MPU podcast episode IIRC.\nMathsnip\nSurprisingly good LaTeX-aware OCR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebapps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYNAB\nBudgeting and finance management.\nGmail\nUntil I setup Mailmate again, I’m checking email in my browser. 🙈\nGSuite (Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Calendar)\nI use these when others use them.\nZapier, IFTTT, Integromat\nA few automations here and there, still on my bucket list to take full advantage here. Integromat has been great for tracking Exportober contributions, incidentally!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmissions\n\n\n\n\n\n(aka stuff I used to use but don’t use as much now.)\n\nKarabiner Elements. I was quite taken in by the possibilities offered by “God Mode”, but I realised that I prefer sequential shortcuts - like the ones I managed to setup in KM - to ones powered by arbitrary combinations of simultaneous keypresses.\nMailmate. Will very likely be back in the workflow soon!\nThings. Retired when I switched to “Notion for Everything”. That said, Things is absolutely awesome!\nUlyssess. Replaced by Notion → Craft → Obsidian → Notion.\nBear. Replaced by Notion → Craft → Obsidian → Notion.\nSublime Text. Replaced by VSCode.\n2Do. Replaced by Things a long time ago, but a really nice app!\nShift. Combines many windows in one, basically. Not sure if it was sufficiently useful, living without it and not missing it much.\nIM+. Similar to Shift in scope, although this one is available on Setapp.\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s on your list? Do share in the comments below!\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nNB. This list does not include fonts and scripts — that’s for a separate round up in due course.↩︎\nI have nothing against paid subscriptions for software in general, but Fantastical’s pricing for the feature set does seem to have an unclear cost-benefit tradeoff, at least for users like me. I haven’t missed much since moving on.↩︎"

It aims to bring together teachers, educators and researchers to discuss issues of curriculum, pedagogy, policy and implementation, related to bringing computational thinking to schools.\n\nCTiS2021 aims to provide a platform for teachers, educators and experts to share their best practices as well as challenges faced in implementing computational thinking in education. The discussions will focus on integrating CT activities (both plugged and unplugged) in various school subjects, on student learning outcomes and on disseminating findings of CT based experiments or classroom research conducted by teachers and educators across the country.\nOur 4-day conference features key note speakers, Hal Abelson, MIT, USA, Manish Jain, IIT Gandhinagar, Patricia Ordóñez, University of Puerto Rico Río Piedras and Wolfgang Slany, TU Graz, Austria. The conference also features a workshop on CT and inclusion, conducted by Supriya Dey, Vision Empower and Manohar Swaminathan, Microsoft Research, Bengaluru and presentations of selected abstracts with sessions on implementation of computational thinking, fun activities and innovative examples used by teachers in classrooms!\nNeedless to say, I’m looking forward to this very exciting program! As a PC member, I also know that the contributed content is fantastic as well, and the aim of this little writeup is to offer a glimpse into this section of the conference.\nIn particular, I want to share with you a puzzle that was described by Rema Nair, who teaches Computer Science at the Mallya Aditi International School in Bangalore, grades 9-12.\nTo begin with, we have an equal number of blue and green boxes positioned as follows:\n🟦 🟦 🟦 🟩 🟩 🟩\nSo the blue boxes are lined up first from left to right, followed by a space that’s exactly enough to fit one box, and then we have the green boxes lined up after the space. The goal is to arrive at the following position, which is essentially what you would have if the blue and green boxes were to switch positions:\n🟩 🟩 🟩 🟦 🟦 🟦\nThe moves of the boxes are subject to the following rules:\n\nThe boxes from the left (i.e, the blue ones) can only move towards the right, and the boxes from the right (i.e, the green ones) can only move towards the left.\nBoxes can move forward one space, or move two spaces by jumping over/moving past another box of a different colour (never over a box of the same colour).\nThe moves are to be made in one direction only.\n\nThe puzzle is solved when the two sets of boxes have switched positions.\nSo how would you get the boxes to switch positions? Are there multiple ways to do it successfully? If so, which strategy leads to the smallest number of moves? This should be a fun conversation-starter in class — and beyond!\nThis is a great activity with actual boxes in a physical setting, but for now, here’s a quick version that you can try out right here, thanks to Polypad by Mathigon* - be careful to not overlap the boxes one on top of the other, they will end up merging! You can always refresh this page to reset 😀\n*Note that the numbers on the boxes are immaterial; notice that given the constraints on the directions, the relative ordering of the numbers is fixed anyway.\nEnjoy playing for now, and join us at CTiS to meet Rema (and other participants).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nRegistration is free but mandatory. The deadline is 28th September. Please head over here to register!↩︎"

For example, if we were obsessed about only firing along rows, we would need four cannon balls to tackle ’em all, like so:\n\n\n\nA solution were we fire along rows alone\n\n\nIf Sam was superstitious about shooting along columns only, then he would again need four of these cannon balls to take care of everything:\n\n\n\nA solution were we fire along columns alone\n\n\nHowever, our friend Sam is smart, not superstitious! And if there is anything that he is obsessed about, it is ruthlessly optimal destruction! In other words, he wants to fix everything up, but while using the smallest number of cannon balls possible… and if that means mixing up ranks and files, so be it — notice that you can manage with just three once you combine the use of both axes:\n\n\n\nA solution leveraging a combination of rows and columns\n\n\nAnd for this example in particular, notice that three cannon balls are necessary, because we have at least three enemies positioned at locations that share neither a row nor a column, implying that no row-fire or column-fire can handle more than one of these locations at once:\n\n\n\nDemonstrating that three canonballs are in fact necessary\n\n\nSo for this example, we know that:\n\nthree cannon balls are necessary &\nthree cannon balls are sufficient.\n\nIn general, let’s say that two enemy positions are mutually independent if they are on different columns and on different rows. Let k be the size of a largest collection of mutually independent positions. Then it is clear that:\n\nk cannon balls are necessary to handle all enemy locations;\n\nbecause any \\ell fires that handle all enemy locations must in particular handle these k mutually independent ones, and each individual fire can get to (at best) one of them — by definition of what it means for two positions to be mutually independent. So if we have a valid solution involving \\ell cannon balls, then \\ell \\geq k.\nWhat is a less obvious, but considerably fascinating, is the fact that:\n\nthere is always a strategy to hit all locations using just k cannon balls. 🤯\n\nA striking situation, no pun intended — the obvious estimate of what is needed turns out to be enough as well! The easy lower bound has a matching upper bound ❤️"

    "text": "Bring in the flows\nIs this much ado for nothing? We seem to have done some translation work, but there’s no proof of this bold claim in sight just yet… 😬\nFair. So here’s a roadmap for what we plan to do next:\n\nUse the graph G as the basis of a flow network.\nRecall the maxflow-mincut duality.\nProfit. Show the duality that we are interested in by hooking it up the known one.\n\nSo first things first: we are going to setup a flow network around the graph G, and here’s a partial picture of what it looks like:\n\n\n\nThe flow graph\n\n\nHere’s the official description of how we build this up:\n\nStart with the graph G, and orient every edge between a row vertex and a column vertex so that every such edge originates from the row vertex and latches on to the column vertex.\nWe assign infinite capacities to all the edges in G. Go unlimited on the originals! We will even dub these edges original edges going forward.\nAdd a source vertex s and add unit-capacity edges (s,r) for every row vertex r. We will call these edges the row selectors.\nAdd a target vertex t and add unit-capacity edges (c,t) for every column vertex c. We will refer to these edges as column selectors.\n\nThat’s it, that’s the flow network (\\tilde{G},\\kappa) based on G, where I’m using \\kappa to denote the capacity function. Now let’s stare at any valid integral flow in this network — what does it pull out from the middle? 🤔\n\n\n\nA matching hiding in plain sight\n\n\nLet’s make the following quick observations in the context of a valid integral flow f in (\\tilde{G},\\kappa):\n\nThe flow on any edge e from G (i.e, an original edge) is either zero or one. Indeed, if f(e) > 1, then we violate conservation constraints at both endpoints of e.\nFor any row or column vertex, at most one original edge incident to it is used by the flow f. In other words, f(e) = 0 for all but at most one original edge incident to any row or column vertex. Again, if not, combined with the fact that f is integral and that the row and column selectors have unit capacity, we will violate conservation constraints on the vertex under consideration.\n\nBased on these observations, we have that the set of original edges for which f(e) = 1 forms a matching in back in G, and in particular, if f was maximum flow, then this set would correspond to a maximum-sized matching. Now, let’s look at the corresponding mincut by building the residual graph:\n\n\n\nEdges in the residual graph that have a residual capacity of zero are not shown. Also, the original edges that were used by f have infinite residual capacity but their corresponding back-edges have unit capacity, but this distinction is not emphasised in the picture because it’s not particularly relevant to our discussion.\n\n\nEdges in the residual graph that have a residual capacity of zero are not shown. Also, the original edges that were used by f have infinite residual capacity but their corresponding back-edges have unit capacity, but this distinction is not emphasised in the picture because it’s not particularly relevant to our discussion.\nand considering what vertices are reachable from s:\n\n\n\nThe vertices reachable from s are marked green, while all remaining vertices are marked red.\n\n\nThe vertices reachable from s are marked green, while all remaining vertices are marked red.\nIn the residual graph, I would like to draw your attention to:\n\nrow vertices that are unreachable from s,\ncolumn vertices from where it is impossible to reach t.\n\nWe will refer to these vertices as the misfits — they are highlighted for you in the picture below:\n\n\n\nThe misfits\n\n\nNow roll up your sleeves for some magic. Let’s pull up the cut — which we know is in fact a mincut — obtained by considering the set of vertices reachable from s the residual graph corresponding to the maxflow f. In pictures, note how we have attracted some column vertices to the s-side, and pushed away some row vertices to the t-side:\n\n\n\nSome reorganization\n\n\nNote that this is a minimum cut, that is to say, the total capacity of the edges crossing the cut is as small as possible — which means that, in particular, the total capacity is at least (or should that be at most?) finite, and that implies, even more particularly, that none1 of the original edges cross this cut.1 Remember how their capacities were infinite? So they just cannot afford to cross a minimum-capacity cut.\nSo every original edge is confined to the s-camp or the t-camp; but note that every original edge is an edge between a row vertex and a column vertex; so if you put two and two together, you see that, in fact, every edge must be incident to a misfit vertex. This means that the misfits are what we were looking for all along — they form a vertex cover of G!\nSo at least we have some solution. Is this the best we can hope for?\nWhy yes!\nNote that every misfit vertex contributes exactly one unit-capacity edge to the minimum cut: the misfits on the s-side are incident to column selectors, and these edges connect with t on the other side; while misfits on the t-side are incident to row selectors, and these edges connect with s, which is again on the opposite end. So every misfit vertex contributes exactly one edge to the minimum cut — and there are no other edges that cross the cut, so we have the following sequence of equalities:\n\nsize of the proposed solution = #misfits\n#misfits = capacity of the minimum cut\ncapacity of the minimum cut = value of the maximum flow\nvalue of the maximum flow = size of a maximum matching back in G\nsize of a maximum matching back in G = lower bound on our solution\n\nTherefore, we have proposed a solution whose cost matches a lower bound on it, making it optimal! With a slight adjustment of language (dropping misfits in favor of vertex cover), the sequence of inequalities above also shows that the size of a minimum vertex cover in a bipartite graph equals the size of a maximum matching in the graph.\nThis was the relationship I’d promised to cover when we started, and it goes by Kőnig’s theorem in case you’d like to find out more — the argument we came up with here isn’t perhaps the traditional proof, and this is a fact that can be established in several different ways, all fun in their own way ❤️"

I don't use Markdown, but it still works as a quick, lightweight publishing system, automatic ssh setup, etc. Since I store the content on GitHub anyway, everything is nicely unified.\n\n— ShriramKrishnamurthi (@ShriramKMurthi) September 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay not commit for mutual accountability :) But a suggestion.Instead of blogging platforms, how about markdown/Jupyter notebooks in a github repo and/or short code/docs as github gists?Can use versioning to improve - no need to get the content \"right\" at the first \"publish\".\n\n— A.

    "text": "Given that I have been spending most of my time in Notion of late, it made sense to wonder if I could use Notion, directly or otherwise, for whenever I have a need to put something up on a public website — e.g, course pages, event websites, and the like. It should go without saying that there are now a gazillion ways of putting a website together — ranging from Wordpress to modern frameworks that have made good old static sites cool again (I’m looking at you, SSGs on the JAMstack), and a whole bunch of things in between. All of this is way out of scope of this discussion, which is really limited to exploring the most reasonable ways of turning your Notion content into a website and is largely in the spirit of a no-code setup.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s almost like there’s something missing between static HTML and full JavaScript software.\n\n— Wes Souza 🏳️‍🌈⬣ (@__WesSouza) September 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, it feels like we are now at a point where it’s easier to make complex websites but somehow oddly harder to make the simple ones!\n\n— Neeldhara (@neeldhara) September 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 Most options here ultimately amount to SSGs in the background, but with varying levels of exposure to what’s happening at the low-level.\n\nThere are a few different options out there if you are interested in this as well, and here’s a handwritten TLDR-summary1 if you find the rest of this little discussion too long:1 TIL that this style of summarization is also called a Pugh chart, thanks to Justin Lai.\n\n\n\nNotion Website Options Compared\n\n\n\nNow for the more detailed run-down:\n\nJust Use Notion\nThe official Notion documentation shows us how to build nice websites with Notion:\n\nThis is a great option for putting together something quick and temporary or for testing something out. It can be free (if you are on the Notion free plan) and/or will cost you nothing on top of what you might be paying for already if you are paying Notion user.\n\n\n\"What's the link to your site?\"\"Oh it's acmedesign dot notion dot site slash dd5a6abe47444a53b7170afd67942d77\"🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏼🙅🏻‍♀️Now for folks with paid plans, you can set a public home page like https://t.co/tf1bBQcNJy! pic.twitter.com/LFWYQtgloq\n\n— Notion (@NotionHQ) September 21, 2021\n\n\n\n💡 If you have a more serious use-case, however, and are concerned about things like performance, SEO, custom domains, and such, and want to exercise more control over the look and feel of your site, you probably want to move beyond what you can get with xyz.notion.site. Still, a great option — involving no extra costs and right out of the box — and I’d imagine this covers a number of use-cases! 👍\n\n\n\nFruition and Cloudflare Workers\nA popular way to get your domain to point to your Notion setup and customize the look and feel of the final setup just a little bit is via Fruition:\n\nAs mentioned on the website already, one downside is the setup time — but I don’t think this is a very serious drawback at all, it’s a one-time exercise and not very difficult at all given the very clear instructions given on the website. However, I think there is a more significant concern with this option, which was highlighted by @bensomething in this Tweet thread:\n\n\nPerhaps a good example of why you should avoid custom domain solutions for Notion that use those damn Cloudflare worker scripts. But hey, super excited for my new startup (fartup?) to be featured on the Founded by Monzonauts website! @monzo @hugocornejo https://t.co/0FH916uvd2\n\n— Ben Smith (@bensomething) January 26, 2021\n\n\nYou could have a (potentially your) Fruition site intercepted with random content, as is the case here. As Ben points out, it’s much safer to convert your Notion content into a static site:\n\n\nAnything that converts your Notion pages to static versions is fine! It definitely seems like Super's leading the pack, but I'd say a substantial number of people are still using something like Fruition.\n\n— Ben Smith (@bensomething) January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n💡 To summarize what we have with Fruition: it’s probably okay for a small test setup, and it’s a cool experiment — largely free (you might hit up Cloudflare’s limits eventually and be prompted to upgrade) and not much work to setup — but I’d be wary of using it in production for any non-trivial project.\n\n…and so we’re going to explore a few ways of doing that now.\n\n\nnextjs-notion-starter-kit and react-notion-x\nThe nextjs-notion-starterkit is a NextJS template built by @transitive_bs, which is in active use here:\n\nYou can check out the repository here. If you are feeling even braver, you might even want to explore what powers this under the hood, which is the react-notion-x repository here:\n\n\n💡 Using nextjs-notion-starterkit is definitely a whole lot safer than Fruition, but it’s also clearly a whole lot more intensive in terms of setup! This option is great in terms of being free and highly customizable, but is best-suited to those who are already familiar with Next.js and who generally know what they are doing. So if the readme pages on those repositories did not make much sense, it’s probably best to either get some help on the initial setup or move on to more user-friendly, truly no-code options. That’s what we have up next!\n\nreact-notion-x — from a safe distance as far as I am concerned — appears to be very well-documented and actively maintained. The documentation speaks of hosting on Vercel, and my guess is that hosting on Netlify should also be possible. Both of these options have generous free tiers, so this could potentially be a no-cost option, although it’s far from being a true no-code option, at least for the initial setup!\nInterestingly, react-notion-x appears to be supported by Super, and from a quick glance at the source code, it seems like both Super and Potion (which are the last two options that we’ll be getting to) generate static sites using the Next.js framework… chances are that what is in these repositories is suggestive of at least a part of what’s going on behind-the-scenes with Super and Potion.\nMy understanding from exchanges with support at both Super and Potion is that there are differences in the implementation details — there are definitely visible differences that indicate this too, and apparently Super is more closely-knit into the Notion API, but I am not sure what to make of that just yet… it possibly makes their implementation a little less vulnerable to being broken by updates at Notion’s end, but I don’t know enough to say this for sure.\n\n\nSuper\nSuper (on ProductHunt), built by @Traf and @TrillCyborg (Jason Werner) appears to be one of the leading options in terms of a no-code way of porting a Notion page to a website. This will set you back $12/site/month; but you get a substantial feature set in return:\n\nI should point out that some Super templates are premium and will cost separately, but there are some really nice free ones that you can run with right away. One that I really liked happens to be free and is in use on the website I have for my courses. I had a completely painless setup experience and very responsive support on the minor things that I did get stuck on (h/t: @camincoll).\nSites made with Super are performant, SEO-friendly, and fairly customizable. There are only two minor snags I ran into with Super: one is that updates on Notion take some time to reflect on the website (typically a minute or so — this is no big deal in general, but it’s just not real-time, and can feel slow while in testing and development). The other is that their terms of service seem a bit unusually restrictive — for instance, see the discussion initiated by @kulikalov here:\n\n\nThat's a shaky foundation to work with @super_ 😐 pic.twitter.com/yYQYuGZk3u\n\n— Anton Kulikalov 🇺🇦 (@kulikalov) August 27, 2021\n\n\n\n💡 At $12/site/month Super is the most expensive option on this list, but if the combination of performance and convenience is what you are looking for, you might find that it is totally worth it.\n\nFrom Super’s responses in this conversation, I am optimistic that the ToS will change for the better. From my direct experience, my instinct is that there isn’t really anything to worry about here, but if you are someone who cares about the fine print, this is an aspect you might want to be aware of.\n\n\nPotion\nFinally, we have Potion (on ProductHunt), made by @noahwbragg (Noah Bragg), which is yet another way of getting a static site out of your Notion content in a fairly straightforward way:\n\n\n💡 While oversimplified, it is tempting to summarize Potion’s offering as “Super, but cheaper”. See the next section for a more detailed discussion of differences and similarities between the two. Overall, Potion has a very similar feature set and is slightly more affordable in comparison — definitely worth checking out the same way that Super is.\n\nThe pricing is a bit different from Super — it can cost you as little as $6.25/site/month on their 8-sites plan, which will set you back $50/month, and the other two possibilities are $10/month for one site or $25/month for three.\nIn terms of what it does, it feels rather similar to Super, but as I mentioned earlier, I think there are differences in the actual implementation. In particular, one difference that is conspicuous is the way Potion renders changes — much like what happens with Notion’s own public pages, the rendering of changes with Potion happens practically in real-time. This is very helpful, especially when you are working on quick edits, or are testing things out.\nMany other features are at par with Super: the sites created by Potion appear to be equally performant and SEO-friendly; and sites on Potion are customizable in almost the same ways.\nThis page (and the whole blog) is rendered with Potion. Like Super, setup was largely frictionless and I had prompt help whenever I needed it. Potion also has a bunch of templates that work out of the box — a couple of which are premium — but the vast majority of them are available for free and already there are some fairly nice options.\n\n\nPotion v/s Super\nGiven the similarities between Potion and Super, I felt it was worth having a separate discussion comparing the two, and I felt like I could do a brief take on this given that I’ve spent a fair amount of time trying out both and being conflicted about which one to go with! As you can probably tell if you read this far, I could not positively conclude one way or the other, so my setups are split between the two at the moment, and it’ll probably stay this way for a while now 😀\nBack to the comparison — there are a few differences on the minor features, here are a couple of examples off the top of my head:\n\nSuper allows password protection on individual pages, on Potion it’s all-or-none (at least at the time of this writing).\nPotion automatically generates preview images based on titles — this is what shows up when you share a link on, say, Twitter or Discord or WhatsApp. It does this automatically for all pages, even ones within databases.\nI could not get jquery to work in Potion (from trying very briefly), but it worked out fine on Super.\nSuper has a community forum and an arguably restrictive ToS. Potion has neither at the time of this writing.\nPotion’s dashboard has a live preview editor which lets you make simple changes to the CSS and preview them real-time — this may not be something you use often if you have made sophisticated customizations, but for quick edits to the default templates, it’s very handy:\n\n\nSuper has a great dashboard too, there’s a page-by-page breakup on the sidebar and a live preview of the site to the right, which shows up even when the individual pages are password-protected (by design):\n\n\nIn terms of custom code, a small difference is that Super allows you to insert your own content inside both the <head> and <body> tags while Potion is restricted to just the <head> tag. That said, additional possibilities for custom code injection are on Potion’s roadmap.\nThere are differences of implementation under the hood, but I am not aware of the exact details here. Super uses the Notion API and a Content Delivery Network (CDN) - this explains why changes take 1-2 mins to flow through from Notion in Super automatically, but what it does get you is reliable performance at scale. Potion uses Vercel for hosting and generates static sites that feel fast and robust, and also uses a CDN.\n\nHere are some of the things that I think work out rather similarly on both platforms:\n\nAccessible and very friendly support 🤩\nConvenient to setup and use.\nSEO, pretty URLs, custom domains, pretty-URLs, and mostly performant websites.\nCustomized output thanks to the ability to insert your own scripts and CSS.\nPromising roadmaps on both with exciting features on the way 🎉\nBoth options seem generally reliable - I have been monitoring my websites using Fathom and I’ve had a few downtimes reported here and there from both platforms. There was nothing that lasted more than a few minutes at a time. Because both Super and Potion use a CDN, it turns out that even if these services go down, hopefully the sites will still be served as usual.\nYou will find that both have great feedback on ProductHunt (and possibly other platforms too, but PH is the one I’m familiar with).\n\n\n\nShould you use Notion for your website at all?\nWell. In general, if future-proofness is crazy important to you, and you want complete control over how your website renders down to the last pixel — then you might want to consider looking beyond Notion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIndeed, these are early days, in some sense even for Notion, and much more so for all the options listed here. A few ways of turning Notion content into websites have come-and-gone, and that, I think, is in the nature of this kind of a setup.\nAt the moment, all options here other than the native Notion setup will have some obligation to keeping up with changes from the Notion side. I think most options are doing great on this front — as a recent example that comes to mind, globally synced blocks were supported shortly on all platforms after release (you do have to make sure that the pages on which such blocks originate have public access permissions).\nI am definitely keeping my fingers crossed for the long-term viability of these options 🤞 Until then, I’m looking forward to enjoying the convenience of being able to work on my website(s) without getting out of Notion at all, at least hopefully not very much 😎\nIncidentally, Notion’s markdown export is pretty good too, so you could just keep markdown versions of your work as you go along, so in case you decide to port things over into a more direct SSG setup in the future, it would be relatively painless to do.\n\n\nAssuming you are all-in on using Notion for delivering your website, then here’s a summary of your options:\n\nIf you are looking for a free setup:\n\nIf need to use custom domains, and need sites that look and behave like regular websites, then you might want to check out react-notion-x or nextjs-notion-starterkit if you are an expert, but otherwise, the Notion route may not be the best for you.\nIf you are already a Notion user and you just need a URL with content that can go around for a super-specific purpose (i.e, website-y features not so crucial) — you can likely just use Notion’s default facility with a public URL.\n\nIf you have a budget that is compatible with Super and/or Potion, I would definitely recommend either of them - they are both great solutions in this context! There are some nuances in terms of how they are different (e.g, pricing; Super’s apparently deeper integration with the Notion API v/s Potion’s real-time implementation, etc.), and if that level of detail is important to you, you might need to try out both — which is fortunately easy to do — before deciding.\n\n\n\nOther ways of getting a website out of Notion?\nThere are a few options that I didn’t cover here, including, for example, Notion2Blog, Notion Dog, Notelet, Nocodepages (now defunct), and a couple of others that I did evaluate — at least briefly — but I unfortunately can’t remember any more. If you know of other examples, please let me know and I’ll be happy to append them to this list here!\n\n\n💡 Please share your comments on Twitter @neeldhara. Also, special thanks to @camincoll and @noahwbragg for their inputs and help with Super and Potion, respectively! 👋🏽"

    "text": "About the Course\n\n\n\n\n\nData structures give us principled ways to stow away information. It’s important to do this nicely based on what you want to do with the information.\nFor example, the notes you might be taking in this class is information. If you have no plans of revisiting them later, you can take them as you please, or better yet, not take them at all!\nHowever, you want your notes optimised for giving you quality company during a 2AM revision session on exam day, competing with Maggi for attention, you want your notes to be competently taken: they don’t have to be neat, and it’s enough for them to be useful.\nOn the other hand, if you are taking notes so that a special someone who will inevitably miss a few classes will almost certainly ask for later, then you would be making notes to impress, and that potentially requires a different approach.\nThroughout this course, we will try to make sense of trade-offs.\n\n\nsequential data (arrays, dynamic arrays, linked lists and variants) • dequeues, stacks, queues • graph representations • graph traversals (BFS/DFS) and applications (connected components, bipartiteness, topological sort) • searching and sorting • heaps • BSTs • (2,3)-trees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course is aimed at undergraduates in their first or second year, as a first introduction to data structures and algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course is largely self-contained. Working familiarity with a programming language will be useful for the labs, where solutions are expected to be written out in C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Data Structures by Pat Morin\nLecture notes by John Bullinaria\nData Structures Using C & C++ by Aaron M.

The manager of the project has proposed the following algorithm to calculate the capability of the group (to undertake project X):\nOn each turn, choose two people, x and y, with capabilities C[x] and C[y] respectively (with C[x] <= C[y]). A unity procedure is followed:\n\nIf the two have same capability value, remove both.\nElse, person x is removed, and capability of person y changes to C[y]-C[x]\n\nIt is obvious that at the end at most one person shall remain. The capability value of the person is stated as the capability value of the group. If no person remains, capability value of the group is taken as 0.\nYou have the find the minimum possible capability value of the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark\n\n\n\nNote that the choice of people for the unite procedure directly affects the final capbility value.\n\n\n\n\nThe first line contains an integer n.

The goal is to construct new roads so that there is a route between any two cities.\nYour task is to find out the minimum number of roads required.\n\n\nThe first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and roads. The cities are numbered 1,2,...,n.\nAfter that, there are m lines describing the roads. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a road between those cities.\nA road always connects two different cities, and there is at most one road between any two cities.\n\n\n\nPrint an integer k: the number of required roads.\n\n\n\n\n1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5\n1 \\leq m \\leq 2⋅10^5\n1 \\leq a,b \\leq n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input\n4 2\n1 2\n3 4\nSample Output\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3. Spreading News\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the dropouts, there are n people left in ES242. The class has students from across different batches and disciplines, so some people know each other while others do not.\nYou want spread a rumor about whether ES242 will be repeated in the next semester. Students who are friends with each other will share any information they get. To get student i to start spread a rumor, you have to pay them in by buying c[i] samosas at Aadhya. Once someone is bribed, s/he tells it to all her/his friends, and they start spreading the rumor to their friends (for free), and so on.\nYou want everyone to catch the rumor. What is the minimum number of samosas you need to buy?\nTake a look at the notes if you think you haven’t understood the problem completely.\n\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5, 0 \\leq m \\leq 10^5) — the number of students in the class and the number of pairs of friends.\nThe second line contains n integer numbers c[i] –— the amount of samosas i-th student asks to start spreading the rumor.\nThen m lines follow, each containing a pair of numbers (x[i], y[i]) which represent that characters x[i] and y[i] are friends (1 \\leq x[i], y[i] \\leq n, x[i] \\neq y[i]).

Predicting Possibility\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are playing a decision making game where the output can be either 1 or 0.\nGiven a N X N matrix, the objective of the game is to predict if it’s possible to reach from a given source to a destination in less than or equal to k moves.\nSome constraints are as follows:\n\nYou can only move to adjacent positions in 1 move.\nYou can only move diagonally across the matrix.\n\nGiven the value of n, and the maximum moves k, determine if you can fulfill the requirement: can you reach from source to destination in less than k moves?\n\n\nThe first line contains an integer n.\nThe second line contains an integer k, denoting the maximum number of moves you can make. \nThe third line contains two space-separated integers, i and j. An entry i j denotes i as the x-coordinate and j as y-coordinate of the source location.\nThe fourth line contains two space-separated integers, m and n. An entry m n denotes m as the x-coordinate and n as y-coordinate of the destination.\n\n\n\nReturn 1 if you can reach from source to destination in less than k moves. Else, return 0.\n\n\n\nSample Input 1\n4\n3\n0 0\n3 1\nSample Output 1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 5. Can You Register?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are a student in a university U.\nYou can only register in a certain program A, if the following condition is met:\nYou have registered for all courses with the course IDs [0,1... num_courses-1]\nIf there exists at least one i in range [0,1... num_courses-1] for which you cannot register, then you cannot register from the program.\nSome constraints are as follows:\n\nSome courses may have prerequisite courses. For example if i is a prerequisite of course ID j, then you must register for i before j\nYou can not repeat a course, you can only register for a course one.\n\nGiven the value of num_courses, and the prerequisite requirements, determine if you can fulfill the requirement: can you register for A (can you register for all the courses in range num_courses)?\n\n\nThe first line contains an integer num_courses.\nThe second line contains an integer num_prerequisites, denoting the number of prerequisites or conditions you have to fulfil.\nThe next num_prerequisites lines contain 2 space-separated integers i and j. An entry i j denotes course j is a prerequisite for course i.\n\n\n\nReturn YES if you can register for program A. Else, return NO.\n\n\nSample Input 1\n2\n2\n1 0\n0 1\nSample Output 1\nNO"

    "text": "Problem 1. A Boastful Cop vs a Clever Robber\n\n\n\n\n\nA robber is trying to escape a cop on an undirected graph G. In the beginning, the cop is at a vertex s and the robber is at a vertex t. (You may assume that s and t are distinct.) They take turns making moves, and each knows the location of the other at all times. A move (by either of them) consists of either staying at the current vertex or moving to a neighbouring one.\nThe cop is boastful, so he announces his moves before making them. Specifically:\n\nbefore anyone makes a move, the cop’s first move is announced - so the robber knows where the cop is headed.\nThen, the robber makes an actual move.\nAfter this, each time the cop moves, he must respect the previous announcement (i.e, move to the previously announced vertex), and then decide his next move and announce it.\nThe robber hears the announcements, so she always knows the cop’s next move before making her own. She makes her move.\n\nIf the cop and the robber are at the same vertex after either of them moves, then the robber is caught. Otherwise, the chase is on!\nThe robber chooses her moves optimally to escape. If she cannot escape, she chooses her moves to maximize the total number of moves until she is caught. The cop chooses his moves optimally to try to catch the robber in as few total moves as possible.\nGiven the graph’s layout and the initial locations of both the cop and the robber, find out whether robber will be caught by the cop and, if so, in how many moves. We say that the game is won by the robber if she’s never caught, and by the cop otherwise.\nIn the figures below, the square vertex depicts the initial location of the robber, and the star depicts the initial location of the cop. Indicate what happens under optimal play. If you choose that the cop wins, indicate how many moves the game lasts assuming optimal play. Each move made by each player counts as a distinct move.\n\n[2 marks] Who wins? __________________\n[2 marks] Who wins? __________________\n[2 marks] If the robber starts on a vertex that is a part of a cycle, then which of the following statements is true?\n⭕️ The robber wins this game.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is equal to the length of the cycle.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is twice the length of the cycle.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves depends on the initial distance between the cop and the robber.\n⭕️ The outcome depends on where the cop starts.\n[3 marks] Suppose the game is being played on a path (i.e, a graph with vertices u_1, \\ldots, u_n and edges (u_1,u_2), (u_2, u_3), \\cdots, (u_{n-1},u_n). Suppose the cop starts at u_1 and the robber starts at u_n. Which of the following statements is true?\n⭕️ The robber wins this game.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is n.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is 2n.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is 2n-1.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is 2(n-1).\n[3 marks] Suppose the graph G has a cycle on the vertices vv_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_kand these are the only vertices that belong to any cycle in G. The robber is initially on a vertex uuand the closest vertex on the cycle is vv_1 via the path ((u,p),(p,q),(q,v_1) The cop is initially on a vertex wwand the closest vertex on the cycle is vv_n via the path ((w,r),(r,v_n) Which of the following statements is true? Assume there are no other vertices in the graph G.\n⭕️ The robber wins this game.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game.\nExplain your answer: if you think the robber wins the game, explain how the robber will evade the cop forever, and if you think the cop wins this game, explain what is the sequence of moves in an optimal game. (You can use the space on the next page.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2. Cheating the Stable Marriage Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a stable marriage instance with A,B,C being the men and X,Y,Z being the women. The input is the following:\n\n[2 marks] What is the output of the stable matching algorithm for this instance? Assume that the men are proposing.\n[3 marks] Consider again the algorithm where men are proposing. One of the women can misreport her preferences to get a better outcome from this algorithm. Identify the woman and explain what preference she can submit instead of her true preference to improve the output from her perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3. Preserving Fixed-Points while Sorting\n\n\n\n\n\n[5 marks] When an array is to be sorted, it may happen that some data values start out being in the same position where they should end up. For example, in the array which is originally:\n45,-4,32,0\nthe 32 is right where it will be in the final sorted output:\n-4,0,32,45\nBut as a particular sorting algorithm operates, it might (depending on the algorithm) move such an element out of the position where it belongs and move it back eventually.\nLet’s say that a sorting algorithm respects fixedpoints if it never moves an element that is in its proper position, on any input.\nConsider the following methods of sorting:\nSelection sort. The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.\nEg: 4 3 2 1 → 1 3 2 4 → 1 2 3 4\nInsertion sort. Insertion sort iterates over the array, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.\nEg: 4 3 2 1 → 3 4 2 1 → 2 3 4 1 → 1 2 3 4\nWhich of the following statements are true?\n⭕️ Insertion sort does not respect fixedpoints but selection sort does.\n⭕️ Selection sort does not respect fixedpoints but insertion sort does.\n⭕️ Neither insertion sort nor selection sort respects fixed points.\n⭕️ Both insertion sort and selection sort respect fixed points.\nJustify your answer. If you claim that a particular sorting method does not respect fixed points, then give an example. If you claim that an algorithm does respect fixed points, argue why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4. Eliminating Jealousy\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have distributed M objects among N children. The set of objects given to a child is called his or her bundle. Each child has a specific value for their bundle: let us say child k has value v_k for their bundle. Each child also has a value for all the other bundles: so let us say that child k has value v_{k,\\ell} for the bundle that was given to child \\ell.\nWe say that child a is jealous of child b if v_{a,b} > v_a, i.e, s/he values the bundle given to b more than the bundle that s/he has.\nConsider the following directed graph G. Introduce one vertex for every child, and add an edge from a to b if a is jealous of b.\n\n[2 marks] Suppose G has a directed cycle u_1 \\rightarrow u_2 \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow u_q \\rightarrow u_1. Describe a way to reassign the bundles (without changing them) so that with the new assignment, all the edges in the cycle disappear (i.e, there is no jealousy between u_1 and u_2, between u_2 and u_3, and so on, with respect to the new assignment). Explain your answer on the next page.\n[1 marks] Suppose G has no directed cycles. Is it true that there is a child who is not jealous of anyone?\n⭕️ Yes ⭕️ No ⭕️ Impossible to conclude from the given information\n[1 marks] Suppose G has no directed cycles. Is it true that there is a child who is nobody is jealous of?\n⭕️ Yes ⭕️ No ⭕️ Impossible to conclude from the given information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 5. Make Strongly Connected\n\n\n\n\n\n[2 marks] In the graph below, what is the smallest number of edges you need to add to make the graph strongly connected? Recall that a strongly connected graph is one where there is a path from u to v for any pair of vertices u and v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 6. Counting Gifts\n\n\n\n\n\n[2 marks] The following is true for n guests at a party:\n\nIn any group of three guests, there are two guests who do not know each other, and\nIn any groups of seven guests, there are two guests who do know each other.\n\nAt the end of the party, everyone gives a present to all the guests he or she knows.\nProve that the total number of gifts given is at most 6n.\nHint: what can you say about the maximum degree of this graph?"

    "text": "— Shashank Srikant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Course\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen starting off their undergrad degrees in science and engineering, most are fueled by an idealism to do great science. However, no formal resources tell us what research—an established path to great science and engineering—is all about, and how one can get started. As a result, many don’t end up figuring out these details, have no idea what the journey promises to offer, and as a consequence, move on to other well-documented jobs and careers. While there’s nothing wrong with taking up well-documented careers, academia and scholarship loses out on quality talent.\nIn another extreme, among those few who are exposed to the idea of research while still in undergrad, there exists a frenzy to apply to graduate programs by the end of undergrad. And to achieve this, students tend to optimize working on projects which will land them ‘the best possible’ publications and letters from professors. While few successfully discover their interests this way, it generally fails as an approach.\nThis course aims to fast-track the process of learning more about research-first graduate programs and/or jobs. It will nudge you to introspect whether problem solving and research is something you will enjoy, and provide some concrete steps for your discovery. It is not designed to merely provide instructions on applying successfully to graduate programs or advanced degrees. Rather, it aims to introduce you to the realities of doing research, which should in turn help you gauge your preparedness for graduate school or a career in research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Instructor\n\n\n\n\n\nShashank is currently a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at the CS & AI Lab (CSAIL), in the department of Electrical engineering and Computer science (EECS) at MIT. He is advised by Una-May O’Reilly. His research interests are at the intersection of machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. He has published his work at top-tier academic venues and has authored multiple patents.\nPrior to his Ph.D. studies, he was a senior researcher at Aspiring Minds’ research lab, where he helped build, deploy, and manage a number of innovative products involving machine learning. These products are used by >1M job applicants across the world today. In this role, he also helped organize international workshops, led academic collaborations, and helped set up communities in India to participate and engage in ML and data science (http://www.datasciencekids.org, http://ml-india.org).\nHe is also interested in governance, and science education and policy. To understand the nuances of how state governments deliver benefits to the last-mile, he worked with Seva Setu, an organization which aims to bridge the gap between governments and people, for a year in rural Bihar in India.\nDetails on his work can be found on his webpage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDates and Time\n\n\n\n\n\n31st October – 5th November • Timing: 6:30PM to 8:30PM • Mode: Online (over Zoom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course material is beginner-friendly: the only pre-requisite is a willingness to commit time and curiosity about research pursuits in computer science (broadly interpreted).\nThe course is designed for undergraduates in computer science and allied areas in any year looking to plan out their first or second research projects, however, participation is not restricted and all are welcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course will be taught over Zoom and will involve several hands-on assignments. The course has the following three sections, with two modules in each section:\n1.The first section focuses on the various motivations for pursuing research projects, the wrong reasons to take up research, exposure to different research-related careers available.\n2.The second section is about the mechanics of getting started with your first research(-ish) project. We introduce some common set of skills every researcher benefits from—taking initiative, reading and writing code, knowing domain-specific tools, parsing papers, communicating over email, and presenting your work. Also learn about the balances you will likely have to strike as you go along, and prepare with us for battles like imposter syndrome or loneliness you may face.\n\nThe third section covers exploring and approaching research opportunities after having cleared the first two sections. We will have pointers to generic opportunities that you can consider applying to. We will also leave you with suggestions for how to level up from after your first research apprenticeship, including information about preparing for graduate school, and discussions about relevant career options within and beyond academia.

    "text": "About the Course\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course will explores the tradeoffs involved in coping with NP-completeness.\nWhen we think about designing algorithms, we are usually very demanding in how we go about it: we require our algorithms to be fast and accurate on all conceivable inputs. This is asking for quite a bit, and perhaps it is not surprising that we cannot afford this luxury all the time. The good news is that most of the time we can make meaningful progress by relaxing just one of these demands:\n\nGive up on accuracy, but not completely: look for solutions that are good enough (approximation) and/or work with algorithms that report the right solution most of the time (Las-Vegas style randomization).\nGive up on coverage, a little bit: let your algorithms work well on structured inputs. Hopefully the structure is such that it is not too limiting and is interesting enough for some application scenario, and is also enough to give you algorithmic leverage, i.e, there’s enough that you can exploit to make fast and accurate algorithms.\nGive up on speed, to some extent: going beyond the traditional allowance of polynomial time, which is the holy grail of what is considered efficient, takes you places. You could either allow for your algorithms have super-polynomial running times, and optimize as much as possible while being accurate on all inputs (exact algorithms), or allow for bad running times on a bounded subset of instances (Monte-Carlo style randomization).\n\nThis course is an introduction to techniques in achieving specific trade-offs, and understanding the theoretical foundations of frameworks that help us establish when certain tradeoffs are simply not feasible.\n\n\n\nFig. Exploring tradeoffs between the demands of accuracy, speed, and coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone who is biting their nails from the NP-completeness cliffhanger at the end of their introduction to algorithms will probably enjoy this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a theoretical course that will require mathematical maturity (in particular, the ability to understand and write formal mathematical proofs), and some background in the design and analysis of algorithms. Programming experience is tangentially useful but not necessary.

    "text": "About the Course\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a course on algorithm design with a focus on issues of modeling and implementation. Each lecture will be focused entirely on one or two problems that reveal the use of a specific algorithmic technique. The techniques themselves are chosen to be in line with those covered in existing NPTEL courses on data structures and algorithms, so that students who complete those courses can find in this course a natural follow up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course is intended for anyone who wants to deepen their appreciation for algorithmic techniques that they have learned in a foundational course and/or would like to take a first step towards preparing for coding competitions such as the ICPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course assumes some background in the design and analysis of algorithm and a working familiarity with some programming language. Knowing C++ is useful but not required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks.\n\nAlgorithms by Jeff Erickson\nOpen Data Structures by Pat Morin\nAlgorithms Illuminated by Tim Roughgarden\nAlgorithm Design by J.

The best 8 out of 12 scores are considered.\n12.5% of the final grade comes from the weekly programming assignments, where the weekly score is the average of the programming assignments every week. Again, only the best 8 out of 12 are considered.\n75% of the final grade comes from the final exam, which is held at a physical location and whose format is similar to the weekly quizzes. Please note that there are no programming-based assessments in the final exam.\n\n Important Note. You will be eligible for a certificate only if average assignment score (quizzes and programming assignments combined) \\geq 10/25 and exam score \\geq 30/75. If one of the two criteria is not met, you will not get the certificate even if the final score is \\geq 40/100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for the course from here.

Ad-Hoc and Implementation\n                In this week, we explore some puzzle-based problems in competitive programming. These don’t require any specific algorithmic background, but instead rely on ad-hoc observations and often simple implementations.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are some practice assignments: the due date is simply the recommended completion deadline.

    "text": "About the Course\n\n\n\n\n\nData structures give us principled ways to stow away information. It’s important to do this nicely based on what you want to do with the information.\nFor example, the notes you might be taking in this class is information. If you have no plans of revisiting them later, you can take them as you please, or better yet, not take them at all!\nHowever, you want your notes optimised for giving you quality company during a 2AM revision session on exam day, competing with Maggi for attention, you want your notes to be competently taken: they don’t have to be neat, and it’s enough for them to be useful.\nOn the other hand, if you are taking notes so that a special someone who will inevitably miss a few classes will almost certainly ask for later, then you would be making notes to impress, and that potentially requires a different approach.\nThroughout this course, we will try to make sense of trade-offs.\n\n\nsequential data (arrays, dynamic arrays, linked lists and variants) • dequeues, stacks, queues • graph representations • graph traversals (BFS/DFS) and applications (connected components, bipartiteness, topological sort) • searching and sorting • heaps • BSTs • (2,3)-trees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course is aimed at undergraduates in their first or second year, as a first introduction to data structures and algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course is largely self-contained.

The manager of the project has proposed the following algorithm to calculate the capability of the group (to undertake project X):\nOn each turn, choose two people, x and y, with capabilities C[x] and C[y] respectively (with C[x] <= C[y]). A unity procedure is followed:\n\nIf the two have same capability value, remove both.\nElse, person x is removed, and capability of person y changes to C[y]-C[x]\n\nIt is obvious that at the end at most one person shall remain.

The cities are numbered 1,2,...,n.\nAfter that, there are m lines describing the roads. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a road between those cities.\nA road always connects two different cities, and there is at most one road between any two cities.\n\n\n\nPrint an integer k: the number of required roads.\n\n\n\n\n1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5\n1 \\leq m \\leq 2⋅10^5\n1 \\leq a,b \\leq n\n\n\n\n\nSample Input\n4 2\n1 2\n3 4\nSample Output\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3. Spreading News\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the dropouts, there are n people left in ES242. The class has students from across different batches and disciplines, so some people know each other while others do not.\nYou want spread a rumor about whether ES242 will be repeated in the next semester. Students who are friends with each other will share any information they get. To get student i to start spread a rumor, you have to pay them in by buying c[i] samosas at Aadhya. Once someone is bribed, s/he tells it to all her/his friends, and they start spreading the rumor to their friends (for free), and so on.\nYou want everyone to catch the rumor. What is the minimum number of samosas you need to buy?\nTake a look at the notes if you think you haven’t understood the problem completely.\n\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5, 0 \\leq m \\leq 10^5) — the number of students in the class and the number of pairs of friends.\nThe second line contains n integer numbers c[i] –— the amount of samosas i-th student asks to start spreading the rumor.\nThen m lines follow, each containing a pair of numbers (x[i], y[i]) which represent that characters x[i] and y[i] are friends (1 \\leq x[i], y[i] \\leq n, x[i] \\neq y[i]). It is guaranteed that each pair is listed at most once.\n\n\n\nPrint one number — the minimum number of samosas you have to buy to spread the rumor fully.\n\n\n\nSample Input\n5 2\n2 5 3 4 8\n1 4\n4 5\nSample Output\n10\nSample Input\n10 0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nSample Output\n55\nNote\nIn the first example the best decision is to bribe the first student (he will spread the rumor to fourth student, and the fourth one will spread it to student). You also have to bribe the second and the third students, so they know the rumor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4. Predicting Possibility\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are playing a decision making game where the output can be either 1 or 0.\nGiven a N X N matrix, the objective of the game is to predict if it’s possible to reach from a given source to a destination in less than or equal to k moves.\nSome constraints are as follows:\n\nYou can only move to adjacent positions in 1 move.\nYou can only move diagonally across the matrix.\n\nGiven the value of n, and the maximum moves k, determine if you can fulfill the requirement: can you reach from source to destination in less than k moves?\n\n\nThe first line contains an integer n.\nThe second line contains an integer k, denoting the maximum number of moves you can make. \nThe third line contains two space-separated integers, i and j. An entry i j denotes i as the x-coordinate and j as y-coordinate of the source location.\nThe fourth line contains two space-separated integers, m and n. An entry m n denotes m as the x-coordinate and n as y-coordinate of the destination.\n\n\n\nReturn 1 if you can reach from source to destination in less than k moves. Else, return 0.\n\n\n\nSample Input 1\n4\n3\n0 0\n3 1\nSample Output 1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 5. Can You Register?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are a student in a university U.\nYou can only register in a certain program A, if the following condition is met:\nYou have registered for all courses with the course IDs [0,1... num_courses-1]\nIf there exists at least one i in range [0,1... num_courses-1] for which you cannot register, then you cannot register from the program.\nSome constraints are as follows:\n\nSome courses may have prerequisite courses. For example if i is a prerequisite of course ID j, then you must register for i before j\nYou can not repeat a course, you can only register for a course one.\n\nGiven the value of num_courses, and the prerequisite requirements, determine if you can fulfill the requirement: can you register for A (can you register for all the courses in range num_courses)?\n\n\nThe first line contains an integer num_courses.\nThe second line contains an integer num_prerequisites, denoting the number of prerequisites or conditions you have to fulfil.\nThe next num_prerequisites lines contain 2 space-separated integers i and j. An entry i j denotes course j is a prerequisite for course i.\n\n\n\nReturn YES if you can register for program A. Else, return NO.\n\n\nSample Input 1\n2\n2\n1 0\n0 1\nSample Output 1\nNO"

    "text": "Problem 1. A Boastful Cop vs a Clever Robber\n\n\n\n\n\nA robber is trying to escape a cop on an undirected graph G. In the beginning, the cop is at a vertex s and the robber is at a vertex t. (You may assume that s and t are distinct.) They take turns making moves, and each knows the location of the other at all times. A move (by either of them) consists of either staying at the current vertex or moving to a neighbouring one.\nThe cop is boastful, so he announces his moves before making them. Specifically:\n\nbefore anyone makes a move, the cop’s first move is announced - so the robber knows where the cop is headed.\nThen, the robber makes an actual move.\nAfter this, each time the cop moves, he must respect the previous announcement (i.e, move to the previously announced vertex), and then decide his next move and announce it.\nThe robber hears the announcements, so she always knows the cop’s next move before making her own. She makes her move.\n\nIf the cop and the robber are at the same vertex after either of them moves, then the robber is caught. Otherwise, the chase is on!\nThe robber chooses her moves optimally to escape. If she cannot escape, she chooses her moves to maximize the total number of moves until she is caught. The cop chooses his moves optimally to try to catch the robber in as few total moves as possible.\nGiven the graph’s layout and the initial locations of both the cop and the robber, find out whether robber will be caught by the cop and, if so, in how many moves. We say that the game is won by the robber if she’s never caught, and by the cop otherwise.\nIn the figures below, the square vertex depicts the initial location of the robber, and the star depicts the initial location of the cop. Indicate what happens under optimal play. If you choose that the cop wins, indicate how many moves the game lasts assuming optimal play. Each move made by each player counts as a distinct move.\n\n[2 marks] Who wins? __________________\n[2 marks] Who wins? __________________\n[2 marks] If the robber starts on a vertex that is a part of a cycle, then which of the following statements is true?\n⭕️ The robber wins this game.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is equal to the length of the cycle.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is twice the length of the cycle.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves depends on the initial distance between the cop and the robber.\n⭕️ The outcome depends on where the cop starts.\n[3 marks] Suppose the game is being played on a path (i.e, a graph with vertices u_1, \\ldots, u_n and edges (u_1,u_2), (u_2, u_3), \\cdots, (u_{n-1},u_n). Suppose the cop starts at u_1 and the robber starts at u_n. Which of the following statements is true?\n⭕️ The robber wins this game.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is n.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is 2n.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is 2n-1.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is 2(n-1).\n[3 marks] Suppose the graph G has a cycle on the vertices vv_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_kand these are the only vertices that belong to any cycle in G. The robber is initially on a vertex uuand the closest vertex on the cycle is vv_1 via the path ((u,p),(p,q),(q,v_1) The cop is initially on a vertex wwand the closest vertex on the cycle is vv_n via the path ((w,r),(r,v_n) Which of the following statements is true? Assume there are no other vertices in the graph G.\n⭕️ The robber wins this game.\n⭕️ The cop wins this game.\nExplain your answer: if you think the robber wins the game, explain how the robber will evade the cop forever, and if you think the cop wins this game, explain what is the sequence of moves in an optimal game. (You can use the space on the next page.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2. Cheating the Stable Marriage Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a stable marriage instance with A,B,C being the men and X,Y,Z being the women. The input is the following:\n\n[2 marks] What is the output of the stable matching algorithm for this instance? Assume that the men are proposing.\n[3 marks] Consider again the algorithm where men are proposing. One of the women can misreport her preferences to get a better outcome from this algorithm. Identify the woman and explain what preference she can submit instead of her true preference to improve the output from her perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3. Preserving Fixed-Points while Sorting\n\n\n\n\n\n[5 marks] When an array is to be sorted, it may happen that some data values start out being in the same position where they should end up. For example, in the array which is originally:\n45,-4,32,0\nthe 32 is right where it will be in the final sorted output:\n-4,0,32,45\nBut as a particular sorting algorithm operates, it might (depending on the algorithm) move such an element out of the position where it belongs and move it back eventually.\nLet’s say that a sorting algorithm respects fixedpoints if it never moves an element that is in its proper position, on any input.\nConsider the following methods of sorting:\nSelection sort. The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.\nEg: 4 3 2 1 → 1 3 2 4 → 1 2 3 4\nInsertion sort. Insertion sort iterates over the array, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.\nEg: 4 3 2 1 → 3 4 2 1 → 2 3 4 1 → 1 2 3 4\nWhich of the following statements are true?\n⭕️ Insertion sort does not respect fixedpoints but selection sort does.\n⭕️ Selection sort does not respect fixedpoints but insertion sort does.\n⭕️ Neither insertion sort nor selection sort respects fixed points.\n⭕️ Both insertion sort and selection sort respect fixed points.\nJustify your answer. If you claim that a particular sorting method does not respect fixed points, then give an example. If you claim that an algorithm does respect fixed points, argue why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4. Eliminating Jealousy\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have distributed M objects among N children. The set of objects given to a child is called his or her bundle. Each child has a specific value for their bundle: let us say child k has value v_k for their bundle. Each child also has a value for all the other bundles: so let us say that child k has value v_{k,\\ell} for the bundle that was given to child \\ell.\nWe say that child a is jealous of child b if v_{a,b} > v_a, i.e, s/he values the bundle given to b more than the bundle that s/he has.\nConsider the following directed graph G. Introduce one vertex for every child, and add an edge from a to b if a is jealous of b.\n\n[2 marks] Suppose G has a directed cycle u_1 \\rightarrow u_2 \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow u_q \\rightarrow u_1. Describe a way to reassign the bundles (without changing them) so that with the new assignment, all the edges in the cycle disappear (i.e, there is no jealousy between u_1 and u_2, between u_2 and u_3, and so on, with respect to the new assignment). Explain your answer on the next page.\n[1 marks] Suppose G has no directed cycles. Is it true that there is a child who is not jealous of anyone?\n⭕️ Yes ⭕️ No ⭕️ Impossible to conclude from the given information\n[1 marks] Suppose G has no directed cycles. Is it true that there is a child who is nobody is jealous of?\n⭕️ Yes ⭕️ No ⭕️ Impossible to conclude from the given information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 5. Make Strongly Connected\n\n\n\n\n\n[2 marks] In the graph below, what is the smallest number of edges you need to add to make the graph strongly connected? Recall that a strongly connected graph is one where there is a path from u to v for any pair of vertices u and v.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 6. Counting Gifts\n\n\n\n\n\n[2 marks] The following is true for n guests at a party:\n\nIn any group of three guests, there are two guests who do not know each other, and\nIn any groups of seven guests, there are two guests who do know each other.\n\nAt the end of the party, everyone gives a present to all the guests he or she knows.\nProve that the total number of gifts given is at most 6n.\nHint: what can you say about the maximum degree of this graph?"

This is work in progress (really :) ), and I hope that eventually we will have most of the materials available from here.\n Watch this space!\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n                NOC23 CS30\n            \n            \n                Getting Started with Competitive Programming  Co-instructor with Atul.\n            \n            \n                2023\n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n            \n                            \n            \n            \n                NOC22 CS82\n            \n            \n                Getting Started with Competitive Programming\n            \n            \n                2022\n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n            \n                            \n            \n            \n                NOC22 CS81\n            \n            \n                Parameterized Algorithms  Co-instructor with Saket Saurabh\n            \n            \n                2022\n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n            \n                            \n            \n            \n                NOC22 CS59\n            \n            \n                Getting Started with Competitive Programming\n            \n            \n                2022\n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n            \n                            \n            \n            \n                NOC21 CS99\n            \n            \n                Getting Started with Competitive Programming  Co-instructor with Arjun Arul\n            \n            \n                2021\n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n            \n                            \n            \n            \n                NOC21 CS92\n            \n            \n                Parameterized Algorithms  Co-instructor with Saket Saurabh\n            \n            \n                2021\n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                    \n            \n            \n                            \n            \n            \n                NOC21 CS80\n            \n            \n                Discrete Mathematics  Facilitating co-instructor • Course by Sudarshan Iyengar\n            \n            \n                2021\n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are courses that I have been involved in coordinating and organizing.

    "text": "— Manish Jain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Course\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will introduce many little-known theorems of advanced mathematics. We will go on a roller coaster ride from delightful self-working magic tricks to serious math, then back again to magic. The tricks don’t require any sleight of hand or trickery.\nA similar course is taught at Stanford University by a former professional magician named Persi Diaconis. At school, Diaconis supported himself by playing poker on ships between New York and South America. Martin Gardner, a writer at Scientific American, once saw him and recommended to a professor for Ph.D. at Harvard University.\nIn two days, we would learn about Hummer shuffles, Royal Hummer, de Bruijn Sequences, Universal Cycles, Mandelbrot Set, Neat Shuffles and many more card tricks. You would have about 10 cool card tricks up your sleeve and you would be comfortable exploring many more as you would know the terminology of math card tricks by the end of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Instructor\n\n\n\n\n\nManish Jain spends most of his time investigating the science behind simple toys, and is passionate about sharing his insights and excitement with people. He is Associate Teaching Professor at Center for Creative Learning (CCL), IIT Gandhinagar, whose goal is to create and foster makers who can take innovation to the next level. Towards this goal, CCL designs and offers deep and joyful learning experiences built around STEM toys and hands-on activities. The ultimate goal is to bring back the gleam in the eyes of students and teachers.\nBefore founding CCL, Manish worked at IUCAA’s Science Centre in Pune, with Padma Shri Arvind Gupta. In his previous avatar, he spent 19 years in the area of chip design at Synopsys (Bangalore & amp; Mountain View), serving as a Director of R&D and Scientist leading Low Power Simulation efforts, where he has 5 US patents.\nManish has a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur (1993) and has also finished a few courses at Stanford University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDates and Time\n\n\n\n\n\n6th and 7st April, 2019 • 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM"

A hands-on introduction to Refute Questions • Viraj Kumar \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help students develop a critical eye for human and (increasingly) machine-generated code, this workshop proposes Refute questions. Students are given code created for a stated purpose and asked: Why does the code fail to serve that purpose? Students must provide evidence demonstrating this failure. After a hands-on introduction to Refute questions in their originally proposed context (an alternative to ‘Explain in Plain English’ questions), participants will receive and review a richer variety of Refute questions for autograded formative and summative assessments, targeting an introductory programming course in Python.\n\n\n\n\n1PM — 2:30PM. Lunch\n\n2:30PM — 4PM. Program Development using Literate Programming and Mapcode • Venkatesh Choppella \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterate programming (Knuth, 1992) is a style of programming and documentation in which the role of code and comments are reversed. A literate programmer writes a narrative and then embeds code in the narrative. This is akin to supporting a narrative with other artefacts like diagrams or tables. Mapcode (Viswanath, 2008) a methodology for iterative algorithmic problem solving in which the requirement and design of an algorithm is expressed as a collection of maps (total functions). Once the design is available, it can be easily coded as program. Literate programming is a natural framework for expressing the design of the algorithm along with its implementation as a program. The workshop is an introduction to literate program development using the mapcode methodology. This will be done through a series of examples which illustrate the mapcode approach and use the literate programming style to encode the solutions in Python.\n\n\n\n\n4PM — 4:30PM.

    "text": "About the Course\n\n\n\n\n\nMost computational problems that model real-world issues are not known to admit efficient algorithms that are provably correct on all inputs. Many of these problems can be reduced to one of the classical problems called NP-complete problems which are unlikely to admit efficient algorithms in practice, and the issue of whether they do is a fundamental open problem in computer science. Although these problems are very unlikely to be solvable efficiently in the immediate future, computer scientists, over the last few decades, have come up with several “workarounds” to “cope” with NP-hardness.\nTwo fundamental approaches in this program include approximation and fixed- parameter tractability. An approximate algorithm is a way of dealing with NP- completeness for optimization problem. This technique does not guarantee the best solution. The goal of an approximation algorithm is to come as close as possible to the optimum value in a reasonable amount of time which is at most polynomial time. On the other hand, parameterized algorithms aim to restrict the exponential blow-up to an identified parameter of the problem, leading to efficient exact algorithms whenever the said parameter is reasonably small. In recent times, there has been substantial research that involves an interplay of techniques from both approaches as well.\nAll paradigms of algorithm design, including efficient polynomial time algorithms as well as the methods of approximation and parameterization discussed above, are substantially more powerful when combined with techniques based on randomness. Carefully employed, randomization leads to approaches that are faster and easier to implement than their deterministic counterparts, making them particularly well-suited to practice.\nOver the last two decades, sophisticated probabilistic techniques have been developed for a broad range of challenging computing applications. To begin with, this course will introduce the basic probabilistic techniques used in the design of randomized algorithms and in probabilistic analysis of algorithms. The course covers the basic probability theory required for working with these techniques and demonstrates their use in various computing applications, especially in the context of parameterized and approximation algorithms.\nThis course will demonstrate the algorithmic techniques in the context of a variety of combinatorial optimization problems that have significant real-world applications. These include: Longest Path, Minimum Cut, Maximum Cut, Clustering, Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, and Closest String.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone who is biting their nails from the NP-completeness cliffhanger at the end of their introduction to algorithms will probably enjoy this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a theoretical course that will require mathematical maturity (in particular, the ability to understand and write formal mathematical proofs), and some background in the design and analysis of algorithms. Programming experience is tangentially useful but not necessary. For students of IITGN, this course naturally follows up on DSA-II.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Design of Approximation Algorithms • David P. Williamson and David B.

Many of these problems can be reduced to one of the classical problems called NP-complete problems which are unlikely to admit efficient algorithms in practice, and the issue of whether they do is a fundamental open problem in computer science. Although these problems are very unlikely to be solvable efficiently in the immediate future, computer scientists, over the last few decades, have come up with several “workarounds” to “cope” with NP-hardness.\nTwo fundamental approaches in this program include approximation and fixed- parameter tractability. An approximate algorithm is a way of dealing with NP- completeness for optimization problem. This technique does not guarantee the best solution. The goal of an approximation algorithm is to come as close as possible to the optimum value in a reasonable amount of time which is at most polynomial time. On the other hand, parameterized algorithms aim to restrict the exponential blow-up to an identified parameter of the problem, leading to efficient exact algorithms whenever the said parameter is reasonably small. In recent times, there has been substantial research that involves an interplay of techniques from both approaches as well.\nAll paradigms of algorithm design, including efficient polynomial time algorithms as well as the methods of approximation and parameterization discussed above, are substantially more powerful when combined with techniques based on randomness. Carefully employed, randomization leads to approaches that are faster and easier to implement than their deterministic counterparts, making them particularly well-suited to practice.\nOver the last two decades, sophisticated probabilistic techniques have been developed for a broad range of challenging computing applications. To begin with, this course will introduce the basic probabilistic techniques used in the design of randomized algorithms and in probabilistic analysis of algorithms. The course covers the basic probability theory required for working with these techniques and demonstrates their use in various computing applications, especially in the context of parameterized and approximation algorithms.\nThis course will demonstrate the algorithmic techniques in the context of a variety of combinatorial optimization problems that have significant real-world applications. These include: Longest Path, Minimum Cut, Maximum Cut, Clustering, Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, and Closest String.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone who is biting their nails from the NP-completeness cliffhanger at the end of their introduction to algorithms will probably enjoy this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a theoretical course that will require mathematical maturity (in particular, the ability to understand and write formal mathematical proofs), and some background in the design and analysis of algorithms. Programming experience is tangentially useful but not necessary. For students of IITGN, this course naturally follows up on DSA-II.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Design of Approximation Algorithms • David P. Williamson and David B.

Can we do better?\nThe answer turns out to be yes: we can improve from O(n^k \\cdot m) to deterministic 2^k \\cdot n^{O(1)} time, which is fixed-parameter tractable in k.\nHaving said that, we will begin with a very elegant randomized algorithm for Vertex Cover, which essentially picks an edge at random and then, one of its endpoints at random, for as long as it can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCute randomized algorithm ALG\n\n\n\nS=\\varnothing\nwhile G-S has at least one edge:\n\npick u,v \\in E(G-S) u.a.r.\npick s \\in\\{u,v\\} u.a.r\nSet S \\leftarrow S \\cup\\{s\\}\n\nOutput S\n\n\nHere are few claims about cute algorithm:\n\nALG always runs in polynomial1 time.\nS is always a vertex cover.\n\\operatorname{Pr}[S is an optimal vertex cover] \\geqslant 1/2^k. \n\nThe first two claims follow quite directly from the operations of the algorithm and the definition of a vertex cover.\nWhat about the third? Well: let OPT be some fixed optimal vertex cover. Suppose |OPT| \\leqslant k. Initially, note that S \\subseteq OPT. In each round, \\operatorname{Pr}[s \\in S] \\geqslant 1/2, since S \\cap \\{u,v\\} \\neq \\varnothing by definition. If s \\in OPT in every round of the algorithm, then S = OPT, which is awesome: and said awesomeness manifests with probability 1/2^k.\nBonus: repeat the algorithm and retain the smallest solution to get an overall constant success probability:\n1-\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right)^{2^k} \\geqslant 1-1 / e.\nApproximation. Do we expect ALG to be a reasonable approximation? It turns out: yes! \nIn particular: we will show that the size of the vertex cover output by ALG is at most twice |OPT| in expectation.\nFor a graph G, define X_G to be the radom variable returning the size of the set S output by the algorithm.\nFor integers k,n define: \nX_{k,n}=\\max_G E[X_G],\n\nwhere the \\max is taken over all graphs with \\leqslant n vertices2 and vertex cover of size \\leqslant k.\nNow let’s analyze the number X_{n,k}. Let G^\\star be the “worst-case graph” that bears witness to the \\max in the definition of X_{k,n}. Run the first step of ALG on G^\\star. Suppose we choose to pick {\\color{indianred}s} in this step. \n\\begin{aligned}\nX_{n,k}=E[X_{G^\\star}] & = {\\color{indianred}1}+\\frac{1}{2} E\\left[{\\color{darkseagreen}X_{G^\\star-s} \\mid s \\in \\text{OPT}}\\right]+\\frac{1}{2} E\\left[{\\color{palevioletred}X_{G^\\star-s} \\mid s \\notin \\text {OPT}}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leqslant 1 + \\frac{1}{2}{\\color{darkseagreen}X_{n, k-1}}+\\frac{1}{2} {\\color{palevioletred}X_{n, k}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNote that:\n\n {\\color{darkseagreen}G^\\star-s} is a graph on at most {\\color{darkseagreen}n} vertices with a vertex cover of size {\\color{darkseagreen}\\leqslant k-1}\n {\\color{palevioletred}G^\\star-s} is a graph on at most {\\color{palevioletred}n} vertices with a vertex cover of size {\\color{palevioletred}\\leqslant k}\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\frac{1}{2} X_{n,k} \\leqslant 1 + \\frac{1}{2} X_{n,k-1} \\equiv X_{n,k} \\leqslant 2 + X_{n,k-1}\nExpanding the recurrence, we have: X_{n,k} \\leqslant 2k, as claimed earlier.\n\n\n\nNow we turn to a problem similar to vertex cover, except that we are “killing cycles” instead of “killing edges”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback Vertex Set\n\n\n\nInput: A (multi-)3graph G = (V,E).\nTask: Find S \\subseteq V(G) such that G \\setminus S is a forest4, and minimize |S|.\n\n\nIf we try to mimic the cute algorithm from before, we might easily be in trouble: note that the driving observation — that an edge has at least one of its endpoints in the solution with a reasonable enough probability — can fail spectacularly for FVS:\n\n\n\nAn example showing that for “most edges”, both endpoints do not belong to an optimal solution.\n\n\nOne thing about this example is the large number of pendant vertices sticking out prominently, and these clearly contribute to the badness of the situation. Happily, it turns out that we can get rid of these:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLemma 1. Delete pendant and isolated vertices\n\n\n\nLet G be a multi-graph and v be a vertex of degree \\leqslant 1. Then:\n\nMinFVS of G-\\{v\\} \\leqslant MinFVS of G\n\\forall S \\subseteq V(G)-\\{v\\}:  S is an FVS for G  \\leftrightarrow S is an FVS for G \\setminus \\{v\\} \n\n\n\nConsider graphs with no pendant vertices and fix an optimal FVS S. Is it true that a reasonable fraction of edges are guaranteed to be incident to S? Well… not yet:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn(other) example showing that for “most edges”, both endpoints do not belong to an optimal solution, even though the graph has no pendant vertices.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, continuing our approach of conquering-by-observing-patterns-in-counterexamples, note that the example above has an abundance of vertices that have degree two. Can we get rid of them? Well, isolated and pendant vertices were relatively easy because they don’t even belong to cycles, but that is not quite true for vertices of degree two. Can we still hope to shake them off?\nOne thing about a degree two vertex u is that if there is a cycle that contains u it must contain both its neighbors5. So you might suggest that we can ditch u and just work with its neighbors instead. This intuition, it turns out, can indeed be formalized:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLemma 2. Short-Circuiting Degree Two Vertices\n\n\n\nLet:\n\nG be a multi-graph,\nu be a vertex of degree 2 that is not a self-loop,\na and b be the neighbors of u (a=b is possible).\n\nLet H be the graph obtained by adding an edge (a,b) to G-\\{u\\}.\nThen:\n\nevery FVS S of G such that u \\notin S is an FVS of H, and\nevery FVS S of H is an FVS of G.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustrating Lemma 2 scenarios.\n\n\nLet us also get rid of self-loops (because we can):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLemma 3. Removing self-loops\n\n\n\nIf G has a vertex v with a self loop then\n\nEvery FVS S of G contains v\nFor every S containing v: S is an FVS of G \\leftrightarrow S-v is an FVS of G-\\{v\\}\n\n\n\nNow let’s apply Lemmas 1—3 exhaustively, which is to say we keep applying them until none of them are applicable (as opposed to applying them until we feel exhausted  ). Once we are truly stuck, we have a graph H that is: (a) a graph whose minimum degree is three; and (b) equivalent to the original G in the sense that any minimum FVS for H can be extended to a minimum FVS of G by some time travel: just play back the applications of Lemmas 1—3 in reverse order.\nRecall that all this work was to serve our hope for having a cute algorithm for FVS as well. Let’s check in on how we are doing on that front: consider graphs whose minimum degree is three and fix an optimal FVS S. Is it true that a reasonable fraction of edges are guaranteed to be incident to S? Or can we come up with examples to demonstrate otherwise?\nThis is a good place to pause and ponder: play around with examples to see if you can come up with bad cases as before. If you find yourself struggling, it would be for a good reason: we actually now do have the property we were after! Here’s the main claim that we want to make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Lemma\n\n\n\nLet:\n\nG be a multigraph with no self loops and minimum degree \\geqslant 3,\nS be an FVS of G,\n(u,v) be a random edge in E(G).\n\nThen:\n\\operatorname{Pr}[{\\color{indianred}\\{u, v\\} \\cap S \\neq \\varnothing}] \\geqslant 1/2\n\n\nWe argue this as follows: call an edge good if it has at least one of its endpoints in S, and bad otherwise.\nWe will demonstrate that the number of good edges is at least the number of bad edges: this implies the desired claim.\n\nThe bad edges. Let X := G \\setminus S. The bad edges are precisely E(G[X]).\nThe good edges. Every edge that has one of its endpoints in X and the other in S is a good edge. Recall that G has minimum degree three, because of which:\n\nfor every leaf in G[X], we have at least two good edges, and\nfor vertex that is degree two in G[X], we have at least one good edge.\n\n\nSo at this point, it is enough to show that twice the number of leaves and degree two vertices is at least |E(G[X])| = |X|-1. But this is quite intuitive if we simple stare at the following mildly stronger claim:\n2 \\cdot (\\text{\\# leaves}) + \\text{\\# deg-} 2 \\text{vertices} \\geqslant |X|\nwhich is equivalent to:\n2 \\cdot ({\\color{darkseagreen}\\text{\\# leaves}}) + {\\color{palevioletred}\\text{\\# deg-}2 \\text{vertices}} \\geqslant ({\\color{darkseagreen}\\text{\\# leaves}}) + {\\color{palevioletred}\\text{\\# deg-}2 \\text{ vertices}} + \\text{\\# deg-}(\\geqslant 3) \\text{ vertices}.\nAfter cancelations, we have:\n(\\text{\\# leaves}) \\geqslant \\text{\\# deg-}(\\geqslant 3) \\text{ vertices}.\nNote that this is true! Intuitively, the inequality is suggesting every branching vertex in a tree pays for at least one leaf — this can be formalized by induction on n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInduction proof sketch\n\n\n\n\n\nDenote the tree by G and remove a leaf u to obtain H. Apply the induction hypothesis on H.\n\nIf the neighbor of u in G is a degree two vertex, then the number of leaves and high degree vertices are the same in G and H, so the claim follows directly.\nIf the degree of the neighbor in u is three in G, then both quantities in the inequality for H increase by one when we transition from H to G.\nIn the only remaining case, the quantity on the left increases by one when we come to G, which bodes well for the inequality. \n\n\n\n\nAll this was leading up to cute randomized algorithm v2.0 — i.e, adapted for FVS as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCute randomized algorithm redux\n\n\n\nALG(G)\nPreprocess:\n\nif G is acyclic return \\varnothing\nif \\exists a self loop v RETURN (ALG(G \\setminus \\{v\\})) \\cup \\{v\\}.\nif \\exists a degree one vertex v RETURN ALG(G-\\{v\\}).\nif \\exists a degree two vertex v RETURN ALG(G/\\{v\\}) (c.f. Lemma 2).\n\n\nMindeg-3 instance:\n\npick an edge (u,v) \\in E(G) u.a.r.\npick s \\in \\{u,v\\} u.a.r.\nRETURN (ALG(G \\setminus \\{s\\})) \\cup \\{s\\}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim 1\n\n\n\nALG always returns a FVS of G.\n\n\nThis follows from Lemmas 1—3 and induction on n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim 2\n\n\n\nIf G has a FVS of size k, then \\operatorname{Pr}[ALG returns an optimal FVS] \\geqslant 1/4^k.\n\n\nThis follows from Lemmas 1—3, the key lemma, and induction on n.\n\n\n\nComing Soon."

Can we do better?\nThe answer turns out to be yes: we can improve from O(n^k \\cdot m) to deterministic 2^k \\cdot n^{O(1)} time, which is fixed-parameter tractable in k.\nHaving said that, we will begin with a very elegant randomized algorithm for Vertex Cover, which essentially picks an edge at random and then, one of its endpoints at random, for as long as it can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCute randomized algorithm ALG\n\n\n\nS=\\varnothing\nwhile G-S has at least one edge:\n\npick u,v \\in E(G-S) u.a.r.\npick s \\in\\{u,v\\} u.a.r\nSet S \\leftarrow S \\cup\\{s\\}\n\nOutput S\n\n\nHere are few claims about cute algorithm:\n\nALG always runs in polynomial1 time.\nS is always a vertex cover.\n\\operatorname{Pr}[S is an optimal vertex cover] \\geqslant 1/2^k. \n\nThe first two claims follow quite directly from the operations of the algorithm and the definition of a vertex cover.\nWhat about the third? Well: let OPT be some fixed optimal vertex cover. Suppose |OPT| \\leqslant k. Initially, note that S \\subseteq OPT. In each round, \\operatorname{Pr}[s \\in S] \\geqslant 1/2, since S \\cap \\{u,v\\} \\neq \\varnothing by definition. If s \\in OPT in every round of the algorithm, then S = OPT, which is awesome: and said awesomeness manifests with probability 1/2^k.\nBonus: repeat the algorithm and retain the smallest solution to get an overall constant success probability:\n1-\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right)^{2^k} \\geqslant 1-1 / e.\nApproximation. Do we expect ALG to be a reasonable approximation? It turns out: yes! \nIn particular: we will show that the size of the vertex cover output by ALG is at most twice |OPT| in expectation.\nFor a graph G, define X_G to be the radom variable returning the size of the set S output by the algorithm.\nFor integers k,n define: \nX_{k,n}=\\max_G E[X_G],\n\nwhere the \\max is taken over all graphs with \\leqslant n vertices2 and vertex cover of size \\leqslant k.\nNow let’s analyze the number X_{n,k}. Let G^\\star be the “worst-case graph” that bears witness to the \\max in the definition of X_{k,n}. Run the first step of ALG on G^\\star. Suppose we choose to pick {\\color{indianred}s} in this step. \n\\begin{aligned}\nX_{n,k}=E[X_{G^\\star}] & = {\\color{indianred}1}+\\frac{1}{2} E\\left[{\\color{darkseagreen}X_{G^\\star-s} \\mid s \\in \\text{OPT}}\\right]+\\frac{1}{2} E\\left[{\\color{palevioletred}X_{G^\\star-s} \\mid s \\notin \\text {OPT}}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leqslant 1 + \\frac{1}{2}{\\color{darkseagreen}X_{n, k-1}}+\\frac{1}{2} {\\color{palevioletred}X_{n, k}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNote that:\n\n {\\color{darkseagreen}G^\\star-s} is a graph on at most {\\color{darkseagreen}n} vertices with a vertex cover of size {\\color{darkseagreen}\\leqslant k-1}\n {\\color{palevioletred}G^\\star-s} is a graph on at most {\\color{palevioletred}n} vertices with a vertex cover of size {\\color{palevioletred}\\leqslant k}\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\frac{1}{2} X_{n,k} \\leqslant 1 + \\frac{1}{2} X_{n,k-1} \\equiv X_{n,k} \\leqslant 2 + X_{n,k-1}\nExpanding the recurrence, we have: X_{n,k} \\leqslant 2k, as claimed earlier.\n\n\n\nNow we turn to a problem similar to vertex cover, except that we are “killing cycles” instead of “killing edges”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback Vertex Set\n\n\n\nInput: A (multi-)3graph G = (V,E).\nTask: Find S \\subseteq V(G) such that G \\setminus S is a forest4, and minimize |S|.\n\n\nIf we try to mimic the cute algorithm from before, we might easily be in trouble: note that the driving observation — that an edge has at least one of its endpoints in the solution with a reasonable enough probability — can fail spectacularly for FVS:\n\n\n\nAn example showing that for “most edges”, both endpoints do not belong to an optimal solution.\n\n\nOne thing about this example is the large number of pendant vertices sticking out prominently, and these clearly contribute to the badness of the situation. Happily, it turns out that we can get rid of these:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLemma 1. Delete pendant and isolated vertices\n\n\n\nLet G be a multi-graph and v be a vertex of degree \\leqslant 1. Then:\n\nMinFVS of G-\\{v\\} \\leqslant MinFVS of G\n\\forall S \\subseteq V(G)-\\{v\\}:  S is an FVS for G  \\leftrightarrow S is an FVS for G \\setminus \\{v\\} \n\n\n\nConsider graphs with no pendant vertices and fix an optimal FVS S. Is it true that a reasonable fraction of edges are guaranteed to be incident to S? Well… not yet:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn(other) example showing that for “most edges”, both endpoints do not belong to an optimal solution, even though the graph has no pendant vertices.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, continuing our approach of conquering-by-observing-patterns-in-counterexamples, note that the example above has an abundance of vertices that have degree two. Can we get rid of them? Well, isolated and pendant vertices were relatively easy because they don’t even belong to cycles, but that is not quite true for vertices of degree two. Can we still hope to shake them off?\nOne thing about a degree two vertex u is that if there is a cycle that contains u it must contain both its neighbors5. So you might suggest that we can ditch u and just work with its neighbors instead. This intuition, it turns out, can indeed be formalized:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLemma 2. Short-Circuiting Degree Two Vertices\n\n\n\nLet:\n\nG be a multi-graph,\nu be a vertex of degree 2 that is not a self-loop,\na and b be the neighbors of u (a=b is possible).\n\nLet H be the graph obtained by adding an edge (a,b) to G-\\{u\\}.\nThen:\n\nevery FVS S of G such that u \\notin S is an FVS of H, and\nevery FVS S of H is an FVS of G.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustrating Lemma 2 scenarios.\n\n\nLet us also get rid of self-loops (because we can):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLemma 3. Removing self-loops\n\n\n\nIf G has a vertex v with a self loop then\n\nEvery FVS S of G contains v\nFor every S containing v: S is an FVS of G \\leftrightarrow S-v is an FVS of G-\\{v\\}\n\n\n\nNow let’s apply Lemmas 1—3 exhaustively, which is to say we keep applying them until none of them are applicable (as opposed to applying them until we feel exhausted  ). Once we are truly stuck, we have a graph H that is: (a) a graph whose minimum degree is three; and (b) equivalent to the original G in the sense that any minimum FVS for H can be extended to a minimum FVS of G by some time travel: just play back the applications of Lemmas 1—3 in reverse order.\nRecall that all this work was to serve our hope for having a cute algorithm for FVS as well. Let’s check in on how we are doing on that front: consider graphs whose minimum degree is three and fix an optimal FVS S. Is it true that a reasonable fraction of edges are guaranteed to be incident to S? Or can we come up with examples to demonstrate otherwise?\nThis is a good place to pause and ponder: play around with examples to see if you can come up with bad cases as before. If you find yourself struggling, it would be for a good reason: we actually now do have the property we were after! Here’s the main claim that we want to make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Lemma\n\n\n\nLet:\n\nG be a multigraph with no self loops and minimum degree \\geqslant 3,\nS be an FVS of G,\n(u,v) be a random edge in E(G).\n\nThen:\n\\operatorname{Pr}[{\\color{indianred}\\{u, v\\} \\cap S \\neq \\varnothing}] \\geqslant 1/2\n\n\nWe argue this as follows: call an edge good if it has at least one of its endpoints in S, and bad otherwise.\nWe will demonstrate that the number of good edges is at least the number of bad edges: this implies the desired claim.\n\nThe bad edges. Let X := G \\setminus S. The bad edges are precisely E(G[X]).\nThe good edges. Every edge that has one of its endpoints in X and the other in S is a good edge. Recall that G has minimum degree three, because of which:\n\nfor every leaf in G[X], we have at least two good edges, and\nfor vertex that is degree two in G[X], we have at least one good edge.\n\n\nSo at this point, it is enough to show that twice the number of leaves and degree two vertices is at least |E(G[X])| = |X|-1. But this is quite intuitive if we simple stare at the following mildly stronger claim:\n2 \\cdot (\\text{\\# leaves}) + \\text{\\# deg-} 2 \\text{vertices} \\geqslant |X|\nwhich is equivalent to:\n2 \\cdot ({\\color{darkseagreen}\\text{\\# leaves}}) + {\\color{palevioletred}\\text{\\# deg-}2 \\text{vertices}} \\geqslant ({\\color{darkseagreen}\\text{\\# leaves}}) + {\\color{palevioletred}\\text{\\# deg-}2 \\text{ vertices}} + \\text{\\# deg-}(\\geqslant 3) \\text{ vertices}.\nAfter cancelations, we have:\n(\\text{\\# leaves}) \\geqslant \\text{\\# deg-}(\\geqslant 3) \\text{ vertices}.\nNote that this is true! Intuitively, the inequality is suggesting every branching vertex in a tree pays for at least one leaf — this can be formalized by induction on n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInduction proof sketch\n\n\n\n\n\nDenote the tree by G and remove a leaf u to obtain H. Apply the induction hypothesis on H.\n\nIf the neighbor of u in G is a degree two vertex, then the number of leaves and high degree vertices are the same in G and H, so the claim follows directly.\nIf the degree of the neighbor in u is three in G, then both quantities in the inequality for H increase by one when we transition from H to G.\nIn the only remaining case, the quantity on the left increases by one when we come to G, which bodes well for the inequality. \n\n\n\n\nAll this was leading up to cute randomized algorithm v2.0 — i.e, adapted for FVS as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCute randomized algorithm redux\n\n\n\nALG(G)\nPreprocess:\n\nif G is acyclic return \\varnothing\nif \\exists a self loop v RETURN (ALG(G \\setminus \\{v\\})) \\cup \\{v\\}.\nif \\exists a degree one vertex v RETURN ALG(G-\\{v\\}).\nif \\exists a degree two vertex v RETURN ALG(G/\\{v\\}) (c.f. Lemma 2).\n\n\nMindeg-3 instance:\n\npick an edge (u,v) \\in E(G) u.a.r.\npick s \\in \\{u,v\\} u.a.r.\nRETURN (ALG(G \\setminus \\{s\\})) \\cup \\{s\\}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim 1\n\n\n\nALG always returns a FVS of G.\n\n\nThis follows from Lemmas 1—3 and induction on n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim 2\n\n\n\nIf G has a FVS of size k, then \\operatorname{Pr}[ALG returns an optimal FVS] \\geqslant 1/4^k.\n\n\nThis follows from Lemmas 1—3, the key lemma, and induction on n.\n\n\n\nComing Soon."

Think of the OPTLP variable values as “voting” for characters at each position. For example, if \\ell = 5, \\Sigma = \\{A,C,G,T\\}, and the OPTLP values turn out to be:\n\n\n\n\nA\nC\nG\nT\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.9\n0\n0.05\n0.05\n\n\n2\n0.1\n0.2\n0.4\n0.3\n\n\n3\n0.5\n0.1\n0.1\n0.3\n\n\n4\n0.1\n0.7\n0.1\n0.1\n\n\n5\n0.2\n0.2\n0\n0.6\n\n\n\nThen you might be tempted to “round” the solution to AGACT because for each position p \\in [5], the letters A, G, A, C, and T dominate the vote for that position. However: it turns out that this nautral rounding strategy can be arbitrarily bad!\nInstead of picking the top choice, what we do instead is the following: for every position p \\in [\\ell], treat the x_{p,\\alpha}’s as a probability distribution2 over \\Sigma. Now the randomized rounding step involves sampling from this distribution to obtain the solution:\n\nSet c[p] = \\alpha with probability x_{p,\\alpha}.\n\nDefine the indicator random variables q_{p,\\alpha} as indicating for us when c is different from \\alpha at position p, as a stepping stone to capturing distance eventually:\n\\begin{equation*}\n    q_{p,\\alpha} =\n    \\begin{cases}\n      1 & \\text{if } {\\color{indianred}c[p] \\neq \\alpha},\\\\\n      0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\nThen we have the natural notion of a random variable to capture the distance between the string output by our randomized algorithm and any fixed string t \\in S:\nd[c,t] := \\sum_{p \\in \\ell} q_{p,t[p]}\nIt’s time for our first cool claim.\nFix a t \\in S. What is E[d(c,t)]?\nIt turns out: at most d, and therefore, at most OPTLP, and in turn, at most OPTILP = OPT \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the Expectation\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nE[d(c,t)] & = \\sum_{p \\in [\\ell]} 1 \\cdot {\\color{indianred}\\operatorname{Pr}[c[p] \\neq t[p]]} + 0 \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}[c[p] \\neq t[p]] \\\\\n& = \\sum_{p \\in [\\ell]} 1 \\cdot \\left({\\color{indianred}1 - x_{p,t[p]}}\\right) \\\\\n& {\\color{darkseagreen}\\leqslant d},\n\\end{aligned}\nwhere the last inequality follows from the second LP constraint.\n\n\n\nNote that d(c,t) is a sum of independent 0/1 random variables whose expectation is upper bounded by OPT. So our useful Chernoff variation applies here,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChernoff Bound: a Useful Variation (recall)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe: Let X= X_1 + X_2 \\ldots+ X_n where:\n\nthe X_i’s take values from \\{0,1\\}\nthe X_i’s are independent\n\nLet \\mu_L \\leqslant E[X] \\leqslant \\mu_H\nThen: \n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[x-\\mu_H \\geqslant \\varepsilon \\mu_H\\right] \\leqslant e^{-\\varepsilon^2 \\cdot \\mu_H / 3} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\mu_L-x \\geqslant \\varepsilon \\mu_L\\right] \\leqslant e^{-\\varepsilon^2 \\cdot \\mu_L / 3}\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\n\n\nand we get the following:\n\n\\operatorname{Pr}[d(c,t)-\\text{OPT} > \\varepsilon \\cdot \\text{OPT}] \\leqslant e^{-\\varepsilon^2 \\text{OPT} / 3}.\n\nNow, applying union bound over all n choices of t \\in S, we get:\n\n\\operatorname{Pr}[{\\color{darkseagreen}d(c,S)} > (1+\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\text{OPT}] \\leqslant \\frac{{\\color{darkseagreen}n}}{e^{\\varepsilon^2 \\text{OPT} / 3}}.\n\nSo, if, for example:\n\\frac{n}{e^{\\varepsilon^2 \\text{OPT} / 3}} \\leqslant \\frac{1}{2},\nthen it’s a win! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the bad situation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\leqslant \\frac{n}{e^{\\varepsilon^2 \\text{OPT} / 3}}\\\\\n& ~ \\\\\ne^{\\varepsilon^2 \\text{OPT} / 3} & \\leqslant 2n \\\\\n& ~ \\\\\n\\frac{\\varepsilon^2 \\text{OPT}}{3} & \\leqslant \\ln(2n) \\\\\n& ~ \\\\\n{\\color{indianred}\\text{OPT}} & {\\color{indianred}\\leqslant \\frac{3\\ln(2n)}{\\varepsilon^2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\n\nWe don’t have a win when OPT is really really small, in particular, if:\n\\text{OPT} \\leqslant \\frac{3\\ln(2n)}{\\varepsilon^2}\nWe handle this case with a local search algorithm.\nComing Soon."
