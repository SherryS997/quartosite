##### Lecture Notes 
### _on Data Structures and Algorithms_
---

<p>&nbsp;</p>

These are running notes on selected topics in Data Structures and Algorithms.

I have been developing these as a part of my course on Data Structures and Algorithms at IIT Gandhinagar. Please see the course website for additional materials (e.g, problems and programming challenges).

At the time of this writing these notes are largely raw and informal. They certainly do not substitute --- but hopefully do supplement --- an actual textbook :)

If you have any general comments or questions, please leave them below. Thanks!
