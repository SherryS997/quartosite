##### Lecture Notes 
### _on Advanced Algorithms_
---

<p>&nbsp;</p>

These are running notes on selected topics in Advanced Algorithms.

I have been developing these as a part of my course on Advanced Algorithms that I teach at both IIT Gandhinagar and also as a part of the IIT Madras online BS program. Please see the course websites for additional materials (e.g, problem sets).

At the time of this writing these notes are largely raw and informal. They certainly do not substitute --- but hopefully do supplement --- an actual textbook :) I do borrow heavily from Algorithms by Erickson.

If you have any general comments or questions, please leave them below. Thanks!
