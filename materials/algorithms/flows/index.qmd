The choice of notation, material, and problems is a subset of Jeff Erickson's chapters on Max Flows and Applications of Max Flows.
:::

This week, we will learn about:

a) The problem of finding a maximum flow in a network,
b) the relationship between a maximum flow and a minimum cut,
c) a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for finding a maximum flow [Ford-Fulkerson],
d) a method to decompose a flow into a combination of path and cycle flows.

We will also apply the maxflow algorithm to solve the following problems:

a) Tuple Selection
b) Exam Scheduling
c) IPL Elimination

Detailed notes are coming soon (will be up by 5PM on 26 Jun).
