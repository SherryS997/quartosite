    <p>Mount Carmel College (in Bangalore), my alma mater, is celebrating its Platinum Jubilee this year. A part of this celebration is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hli7XE8pezM">HERSTORY</a>: "75 years of scripting success stories of Confident, Competent, & Compassionate Carmelites".</p>

    <p>I was honored to be among the 75 Carmelites invited for the HERSTORY event today. It was very nostalgic to be back on campus, and the organizers put together an impeccable event that made all of us feel very special. It was humbling to be in inspiring company. I can't thank MCC enough for providing an empowering and fun environment at a crucial stage of my life!</p>
