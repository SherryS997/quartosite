    <p>We introduce a generalization of “Solo Chess”, a single-player variant of the game that can be played on <a href="https://chess.com/">chess.com</a>. We show that this version of the game is NP-complete even if played only by rooks with at most two captures left, or only by queens with exactly two captures left. On the other hand, solvable instances of rooks on 1D boards and pawns on 2D boards can efficiently characterized.
