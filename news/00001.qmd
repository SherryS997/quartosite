    <p>I&#39;ll be co-teaching a couple of new courses this August on the NPTEL platform. The first is about <a href="https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs99/preview">competitive programming</a> (co-taught with Arjun Arul from Codechef) and the second is an introduction to <a href="https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs92/preview">parameterized algorithms</a> (co-taught with Saket Saurabh from IMSc). Both are meant as follow ups to a first undergraduate algorithms course.</p>
