Here's the premise:

> You’re a biologist on a mission to keep the rare honeybee Apis Trifecta from going extinct. The last 60 bees of the species are in your terrarium. You’ve already constructed wire frames of the appropriate size and shape. Now you need to turn them into working beehives by filling every hex with wax. Can you help the bees create producing hives? Dan Finkel shows how. 

This is very reminiscent of the puzzle about [lighting up a grid](../lighting-up-a-grid/index.qmd). The main difference here appears to be that the structure of the base grid is hexagonal, as opposed to being a square grid.
