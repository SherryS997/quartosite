- This is well-known self-working card trick that I first discovered in the text [Parameterized Algorithms](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~malcin/book/) by Marek Cygan, Fedor V. Fomin, Łukasz Kowalik, Daniel Lokshtanov, Dániel Marx, Marcin Pilipczuk, Michał Pilipczuk, Saket Saurabh (exercise 2.20, where it is intended to be an example application of [Hall's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%27s_marriage_theorem)).

##### The Problem

> Alice and Bob are mathematicians who perform a trick at a dinner party. Bob leaves the room and a random volunteer shuffles a standard deck of cards.
> 
> Alice chooses 5 cards at random. She places 1 of the cards face down on a table and then leaves the other 4 cards face up.
> 
> Bob returns to the room. He inspects the 4 face up cards, and in virtually no time he calls out the value of the face down card.
> 
> The cards are not marked in any way and this trick is completely mathematical. Naturally Alice and Bob had prepared to perform the trick so they had a plan of what to do. Can you figure out how they did it?

Use the pigeon-hole principle. Note that Alice chooses both the card to be placed face down and the order of the other 4 cards.
