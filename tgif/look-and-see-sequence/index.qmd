:::

Conway’s see-and-say (or the look-and-say) sequence has fascinated people for years, and is a fun, non-standard example of a sequence. Starting with $a_1 = 1$, we define $a_{n+1}$ as the sequence obtained by saying the previous sequence aloud. The first few terms are `1`, `11` (one one), `21` (two ones), `1211` (one two, one one), `111221` (one one, one two, two ones), `312211` (three ones, two twos, one one). 

We observe that the largest number in the 2023th term of this sequence is a 7, and coincidentally, 2023 is the 7th year of the Btech program in CSE at IITGN. This coincidence makes us very happy.

However, is our observation correct?
