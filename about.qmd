# Background

<p>&nbsp;</p>

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Neeldhara Misra. I am a faculty member with the discipline of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar. My research interests include the interplay of structural graph theory and graph algorithms; tools and techniques in parameterized complexity; computational perspectives on combinatorial games; voting mechanisms, with a special focus on strategic behaviour; fair allocations of resources.

I am also keen on understanding means of bringing computational thinking to school education, and using visual tools and narratives for exposition in general.

In 2007, I finished a Bachelors in Science in three majors â€” Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics, from Mount Carmel College (Bangalore). The Joint Entrance Screening Test (JEST) was one of the very few national exams that I was eligible to write at this point, and this eventually led me to graduate school â€” specifically an integrated PhD program â€” at the Institute for Mathematical Sciences (IMSc).

After graduating from IMSc in 2012, I spent the next three years at the Department of Computer Science and Automation (CSA) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

One of the things I enjoy most about my work is the opportunities that it brings to connect with others, so in case you feel similarly and would like to exchange notes, give me a heads up! I am moving from Twitter to [Mastodon](https://neeldhara.online) and am trying to get better at email, so Iâ€™ll look forward to hearing from you ðŸ™Œ

<p>Neeldhara Misra is a Smt. Amba and Sri. V S Sastry Chair Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar. She completed her PhD from the Institute for Mathematical Sciences in 2012 in Theoretical Computer Science. Her research interests include the design and analysis of algorithms and computational social choice. She is also interested in visualizations and other methods to communicate computational thinking at an elementary level. She also enjoys learning about new card tricks, especially self-working ones --- even though she can't remember any!</p>
