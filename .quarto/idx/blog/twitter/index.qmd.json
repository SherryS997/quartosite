Turns out, this simply wasn't feasible for me by and large.\n\nWith friends who had broader experiences, I had some first-order approximations of what I was missing out on.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I turned to YouTube and podcasts to compensate: for an introvert, being a fly on the wall who didn't have to engage worked out perfectly!\n\nIf not actual intel, I felt I caught enough of the vibe of places I couldn't be, so I largely avoided FOMO.\n\nI've never been particularly comfortable on social media, and I can't remember how or when Twitter became an exception. \n\nSo color me amused by this FT column suggesting that the real reason to leave Twitter is that it's... too comfortable?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JohnRentoul/status/1591355838299799555?s=20&t=nesxsAEMs_n4K9Se8XvjtQ\n\nIt has, indeed, been a comfortable hangout for me: and surprisingly so, considering the nastiness it's known for. \n\nI've taken my chances here and it's largely been very fun, and I daresay my time here has influenced the way I think about many things, for better or worse.\n\nThat said, I suppose I do have my own \"real reasons\" for planning to move on.
