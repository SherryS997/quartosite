It is both an art to be practised creatively as well as a science to be studied systematically. \n\nThis week-long course will provide an introduction to the theory and practice of science communication and outline some fundamental tenets of communicating science strategically. Using interactive approaches like discussions, games, and activities, this course will provide Early Career Researchers with an introduction to the frameworks, formats and importance of science communication, and equip them to design, implement and evaluate their science communication efforts effectively. \n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n# About the Instructor\n\nSiddharth Kankaria is a science communication practitioner and researcher working at NCBS Bangalore and the Founder of the SciCommSci Club – a flagship initiative for engaging with the science of science communication. He is keenly interested in developing the research-practice continuum within science communication, contributing to mentorship, capacity-building &amp; DEI efforts, and developing intersectional science engagement practices for the Global South. Connect with him on Twitter or LinkedIn at @SiddhrthKnkaria. \n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n# Dates and Time\n\n25th July to 29th July 2022 • 4PM --- 6PM\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n# Target Audience\nThe course material is beginner-friendly and hands-on.
