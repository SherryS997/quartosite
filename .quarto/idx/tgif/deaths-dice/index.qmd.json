You plead with him that it's too soon, and he agrees to a concession. Every year, he'll roll a set of dice, and if it turns up snake eyes (both 1's) he'll take your life, otherwise, you get one more year.\n\nBut it's not necessarily a normal pair of dice.\n\nOn the first year, both \"dice\" will only have two sides, numbered 1 and 2.  So in that first year, there's a 25% chance of rolling snake eyes and ending things there.\n\nOn the second year, he comes with tetrahedral dice, i.e. both are four-sided, numbered 1 through 4, and again only takes your life if he rolls two 1's.\n\nThe next year, the dice are six-sided, after that, eight-sided, etc., etc.\n\nEach year you have a lower and lower chance of dying, but he'll come back every year with a new set of dice, never stopping.\n\nYou might think the question now is something like \"what's your expected number of remaining years of life?\"\n\nBut actually, Death gave you a pretty good deal.\n\nThe better question to ask here is \"what's the probability that you end up immortal?\" That is, the probability that Death rolls infinitely many times, with his ever-growing dice, and never once turns up snake eyes.\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n![An image that shows a square circumscribed inside a circle.](deathsdice-hint.png)\n:::"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../css/styles.css","/css/tgif.css"],"toc":true,"html-math-method":"katex","include-after-body":["../../footer.html"],"filters":["abstract-section"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","theme":["simplex","../../custom.scss"],"js":"../../scripts.js","smooth-scroll":true,"anchor-sections":true,"page-layout":"full","title":"Death's Dice","date":"2021-03-15","categories":["probability"],"fields":["date","title"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
