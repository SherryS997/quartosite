The puzzle asks for the probability that Bob emerges the runner up in the tournament.\n[This is indicated in the tweet but the crop seems to hide it.]{.aside}\n\nSuppose we denote the players $\\{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4\\}$, and say the players are initially matched up like so:\n\n$$(a_1,a_2); (a_3,a_4); (b_1,b_2); (b_3,b_4),$$\n\nand in particular we have:\n\n- one of the quarter finals will be between $a_p$ and $a_q$ for $p \\in \\{1,2\\}$ and $q \\in \\{3,4\\}$,\n- the quarter finals will be between $b_r$ and $b_s$ for $r \\in \\{1,2\\}$ and $s \\in \\{3,4\\}$, and\n- the semi finals will be between an $a$-player and a $b$-player.\n\nA moment's reflection reveals that for Bob to be a runner up, he should not meet Alex in the quarter-finals or earlier. This happens if and only if:\n\n- either Alex is one of the $a$-players and Bob is one of the $b$-players, or\n- Bob is one of the $a$-players and Alex is one of the $b$-players.\n\nFrom here it is a counting argument. I was distracted by some idea of symmetry and originally [jumped to the conclusion](https://twitter.com/neeldhara/status/1573691611002769408?s=20&t=-A9VW9YgGCp2qDAyY_Yw6Q) that the answer is one-half.
