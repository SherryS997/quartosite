There is no communication between poeple other than this.\n- All but one person must figure out the color of their hat correctly.\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\nThe first person says \"red\" if the number of red hats s/he sees is even, and \"blue\" otherwise. This person may be mistaken about the color of their own hat. However, knowing the rationale for what the first person called out, the second can tally up parities to determine the color of their own hat (e.g, if the first person said red and the second person sees an even number of red hats, they conclude they are wearing a blue hat, otherwise they know they are wearing a read hat; and so on).\n:::\n\nA crazier version is the following:\n\n- There are infinitely many people in a room.\n- Everyone can see the colors of the hats of everyone else, but not their own.\n- Nobody can hear anyone else's guess.\n- Everyone guesses simultaneously.\n- Is there a strategy to ensure that infinitely many guesses are correct?\n- \\[Level Up\\]: Is there a strategy to ensure that at most finitely many guesses are wrong?\n\n\nThis is fun to think about, and you're probably going to have to invoke something something [axiom of choice](https://divisbyzero.com/2009/08/11/infinite-hat-problems-solutions/) something something to tackle the situation!\n[Spoiler Alert!]{.aside}"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../css/styles.css","/css/tgif.css"],"toc":true,"html-math-method":"katex","include-after-body":["../../footer.html"],"filters":["abstract-section"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","theme":["simplex","../../custom.scss"],"js":"../../scripts.js","smooth-scroll":true,"anchor-sections":true,"page-layout":"full","title":"Hat Puzzles","date":"2022-10-07","categories":["logic"],"fields":["date","title"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
