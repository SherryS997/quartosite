It's important to do this nicely based on what you want to *do* with the information.\n\nFor example, the notes you might be taking in this class is information. If you have no plans of revisiting them later, you can take them as you please, or better yet, not take them at all!\n\nHowever, you want your notes optimised for giving you quality company during a 2AM revision session on exam day, competing with Maggi for attention, you want your notes to be competently taken: they don't have to be neat, and it's enough for them to be useful.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are taking notes so that a special someone who will inevitably miss a few classes will almost certainly ask for later, then you would be making notes to impress, and that potentially requires a different approach.\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Throughout this course, we will try to make sense of trade-offs.\n\nWe'll equip ourselves with ideas that will ultimately help you decide questions like: how do you organise the clothes in your cupboard?\n\n\n|                  | Throw 'em in, nobody's looking | Keep it where you can find it later |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |\n| Time to process  | Negligible                     | Forever                             |\n| Time to retrieve | Forever                        | Negligible                          |\n\n\nTable 1. No free lunches.\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## This *is* in fact a useful framing!\n\n![Table 1 Revisited. No Free Lunches](../figures/ch1-table01.png)\n\n:::\n\n\n## Representing Polynomials\n\n\nLet's say that you are spending a fine evening watching the #LockdownMath playlist from 3blue1brown. The first episode happens to be all about solving quadratics:\n\n![A screenshot from #LockdownMath showing Grant Sanderson solving quadratics.](../figures/ch1-lockdownmath.png)\n\nNow, it's quite natural to want to \"write a program\", so to speak, that can take a quadratic equation such as $x^2 - 7x + 12$ as input and output its two roots.\n\nGiven that programs running on your phone are able to make suggestions, even if dubious, for what series to binge-watch next on Netflix, finding roots of quadratics should be a fairly benign exercise.\n\nYou might recall that most programs let you declare variables that can hold on to specific *types* of information, for instance: numbers, strings, and so forth. Our input doesn't \"look\" like a number, so it would be a fair take to simply store it as a string:\n\n```java\npx = \"x^2 - 7x + 12\";\n```\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## Now...\n\n![](../figures/ch1-meme01.jpeg \"Meme: So preoccupied with if you could, you didn't stop to ask if you should.\")\n:::\n\nWhile this is a perfectly faithful representation, you can imagine that it would be slightly painful to work with. You would have to write some code that can \"pull out\" the parts of the string that represent the *numbers* you care about (in this example, $b = -7$ and $c = 12$), so that you can move on to your calculation, which is an *expression* involving numbers.\n\nGiven that a quadratic with the leading coefficient normalized to one is uniquely determined by two numbers, it seems a lot simpler to directly represent the polynomial as two integers instead:\n\n```java\npx_b = -7\npx_c = 12\n```\n\n\nYou might appreciate that this saves us quite some circus and we can quite directly get to the computation we're interested in. What if you cared about higher order polynomials? You may want to solve them (even if you [run out of expressions for solutions pretty quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2543&v=O5eH3x3sTNA&feature=youtu.be), you might be interested in [other ways of getting to the roots](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1386830)), or manipulate them in other ways (for example, by adding or [multiplying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0) them).\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## Food for thought.\nHow would you represent higher-order polynomials? What about multivariate polynomials? Is there a way that you might be able to capture an algebraic expression for a polynomial without either using strings or just the coefficients?\n:::\n\n\n## Representing a Game - I\n\n\nThe [game of 100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=846A4rgO_os) goes like this: I pick a number between 1 and 10, and then you pick one within the next ten numbers, and on and on. The first person to reach 100 wins.\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## Recall from class and/or figure out that...\n\n:::{.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## SPOILER ALERT\n\t...whoever starts has a way of winning the game:\n\n\t\t0. To begin with, I say 1.\n\t\t1. No matter what number you pick, I can say 12.\n\t\t2. No matter what number you pick, I can say 23.\n\t\t3. No matter what number you pick, I can say 34.\n\t\t4. No matter what number you pick, I can say 45.\n\t\t5. No matter what number you pick, I can say 56.\n\t\t6. No matter what number you pick, I can say 67.\n\t\t7. No matter what number you pick, I can say 78.\n\t\t8. No matter what number you pick, I can say 89.\n\t\t9. No matter what number you pick, I can say 100.\n:::\n:::\n\nWhat if you want to write a program that mimics the winning strategy?\n\nNote that this game can go on for at most a 100 steps, and in fact exactly 20 steps (or ten rounds) when you employ said winning strategy. So one way to go about this is to declare 20 variables to track the 20 numbers exchanged between the players. But a moment's reflection may reveal that you *don't* need to store anything at all.\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n\n## Exercise\n\nCan you write a program that makes the first move, prompts the user for their moves on their turn, uses the winning strategy discussed above, and uses no variables for explicit storage?\n\n:::\n\n## Representing a Game - II\n\n\nIf ~~you missed the first class~~ you haven't played the [Game of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/), you are welcome to take a break and experience it now. Let's recollect the setup:\n\n![Illustration from an implementation by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/trust/).](../figures/ch1-game-trust.png \"Alt text: The Game of Trust. You have one choice. In front of you is a machine: if you put a coin in the machine, the other player gets three coins and vice versa. You both can either choose to COOPERATE (put in coin), or CHEAT (don't put in coin). The image shows a cartoon machine with players on either side.\")\n\n\n\nSuppose you want to implement your own version of this game, where the program responds to inputs from the user and plays according to a specific, pre-meditated strategy. Remember you have seen some strategies already:\n\n![A second illustration from the same implementation by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/trust/).](../figures/ch1-players-trust.png \"Five player strategies also outlined below.\")\n\nWe reproduce these strategies below:\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Player Strategies\n1. COPYCAT: Hello! I start with Cooperate, and afterwards, I just copy whatever you did in the last round. Meow.\n2. ALWAYS CHEAT: The strong shall eat the weak.\n3. ALWAYS COOPERATE: Let's be best friends <3\n4. GRUDGER: Listen, pardner. I'll start cooperatin', and keep cooperatin', but if y'all ever cheat me, I'LL CHEAT YOU BACK TIL THE END OF TARNATION.\n5. DETECTIVE: First: I analyze you. start: Cooperate, Cheat, Cooperate, Cooperate. If you cheat back, I'll act like Copycat. If you never cheat back, I'll act like Always Cheat, to exploit you. Elementary, my dear Watson.\n:::\n\nLet's say that your program is designed to play 5 rounds and that your program is playing the copycat strategy. To begin with, you might want to declare a couple of variables to keep track of the scores of the players, and ten variables to track the moves of both players in each round. With this, your code may start out looking like this:\n\n```java\nmy_points = 0\nuser_points = 0\n\nuser_move_1 = input(\"Input 1 for Cooperate and 0 for Cheat.\")\n\n//Sanity check input:\nif(user_move_1 != 1 and user_move_1 != 0):\n\texpress disappointment and abort\n\n```\n\n\n```java\n// My first move is to cooperate:\nmy_points += -1\nuser_points += 3\n\nif(user_move_1):\n\tmy_points += 3\n\tuser_points -= 1\n```\n\nNow your next move is determined by the value of `user_move_1`, so you might proceed as follows.\n\n```java\nuser_move_2 = input(\"Input 1 for Cooperate and 0 for Cheat.\")\n\n//Sanity check input:\nif(user_move_2 != 1 and user_move_2 != 0):\n\texpress disappointment and abort\n```\n\n\n```java\n// My next move is based on the user's first:\nif(user_move_1):\n\tmy_points += -1\n\tuser_points += 3\n\nif(user_move_2):\n\tmy_points += 3\n\tuser_points -= 1\n\n```\n\n\n...and so on and on, you get the drift.\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## Food for thought.\nDo you really need ten variables to track the game? If you were instead implementing the always cheat or always cooperate strategy, how many variables would you need? What about the strategies of the grudger and the detective?\n:::\n\nNow, suppose we come up with our own player, whom we call the **majority mover**. This player looks at your entire game history, and cooperates if you have cooperated more than you have cheated, and cheats if you have cheated more than you have cooperated, and acts randomly otherwise.\n\nIt seems like implementing the majority mover strategy would really require keeping track of everything. Or would it? You might observe at this point that it's enough to keep track of two counts: the number of rounds and the *number* of moves where the user has cheated: note that it does not matter when the cheats happened in the history of the game.\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## You could also...\n\n...track the number of cooperate moves along with the number of rounds; or the number of cheat moves and the number of cooperate moves.\n\nAt this point it's a matter of taste :)\n:::\n\nHow about a **completely random** player? This one chooses a number **K** between 1 and N uniformly at random (let's not worry about *how* this is done for now, because that would be a story for another day), where N is the number of rounds played so far; and mimics the other player's **K**th move. To implement this strategy, you really would need to keep track of the user's entire game history with the five variables, and also assume that you have a way of picking a number at random.\n\nFinally, consider that instead of fixing your program to play five rounds â€” ðŸ¥± â€” you want to politely ask the user how m*any *rounds they want to play.\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## After all...\n\n![](../figures/ch1-meme02.jpeg \"Meme: we are professionals.\")\n:::\n\nWell, for the first few players, this is just a matter of upgrading your for loop (which you should have switched to already when you realised that you don't need all. those. variables.) to use N: and you are done.\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## Food for thought.\nHow will you implement this version if you are working with our latest player? If you happen to have a very enthusiastic user who asks for half a million rounds, would you be able to declare that many variables all at once, while your program is running? Notably, you don't know what the user is going to say ahead of time!\n:::\n\n## Representing a subset of a deck of cards\n\n\nIf you are implementing a card^[Assume you are working with the [standard 52-card deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck).] game, you might need a mechanism for keeping track of \"hands\", or various subsets of cards. Let's say a *hand* is a subset of cards. For many games, you would need the ability to be able to quickly:\n\n\n- tell if a particular card belongs to a hand or not,\n- add a card to a hand,\n- remove a card from a hand, and\n- replace a card in a hand with another one.\n\n\nOne way to meet these requirements is to declare a collection of 52 boolean (i.e, true/false or 0/1) variables to represent the hand: the cards in the hand are set to true while cards that don't belong are set to false.\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## Food for thought.\nWhat do you like about this method? What don't you like about it?\n:::\n\n\nHere'a another way, though: you could agree on a notation for the cards in the deck: e.g, a standard one is to use a number, A/J/Q/K to denote the value, and S/C/D/H to denote the suit, so every card can be represented as a pair of characters. For example the Ace of Diamonds would be AD, the five of spades would be 5S and the King of Hearts would be KH. With this in place, you could represent a hand also by simply *concatenating* these string representations of the cards in the hand.\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## Food for thought.\nWhat do you like about this method? What don't you like about it?\n:::\n\n\nNow for this toy example, if you were to implement both methods and clock the time taken to implement the four operations above, you may not notice a major difference. However, for actual applications, you may be in a situation where your *subsets* (here, the \"hands\") may be coming from a large *universe* (here, the \"deck\"). On the other hand, you may have a very large number of operations to take care of efficiently.\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## Food for thought.\nAre there other ways that you might want to store this kind of information, given the things you want to do are as enlisted above?\n:::\n\nYour choice of method will again be driven by the requirements: the one thing to keep in mind is that you cannot have it all, but we can usually get pretty damn close!\n\n<br>\n---\n<br>\n\n<div id=\"hyvor-talk-view\"></div>"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../css/styles.css"],"toc":true,"html-math-method":"katex","include-after-body":["../../../footer.html"],"filters":["abstract-section"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.262","theme":["simplex","../../../custom.scss"],"js":"../../../scripts.js","smooth-scroll":true,"anchor-sections":true,"page-layout":"full","title":"Data Structures and Structured Data","date":"2022-08-01","categories":["dsanotes","lecturenotes"],"fields":["date","title"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
