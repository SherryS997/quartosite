Letter-writing season is around the corner. I recently adapted [this pandoc workflow](https://github.com/yangjiandong/myPandoc/tree/faf94dc26487005b03baa7a2d807b20b2a7f233f/demo/letter) for generating PDF letters by only editing a markdown file. I only made the following minor changes to the original:

<aside>
For this to work you will need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and a TeX distribution installed. For a full-fledged TeX distribution check out something like [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) and for a minimal variation, see [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/).

1. Included the `fontawesome5` package so I could add icons alongside the phone number, email, and website in the letterhead.

2. Changed `ThisULCornerWallPaper` to `CenterWallPaper` and added `wpYoffset` and `wpXoffset` so I could get a left margin on the logo (I suppose this _could_ also be done by offsetting the logo in the `letterhead.pdf` file).

Here's what the output looks like with some random sample content:

The markdown is very simple to edit --- most of the information is up in the YAML header, and it looks like this:

```yaml
author: Fyodor Michailovitch Dostoevsky
city: Moscow
from:
- By the Vladimirkirche
- care of Pryanischnikof, Grafengasse.
affiliation1: Add an affiliation
affiliation2: Potential Additional Information
contact: 
- \faPhone \ +91 79 1234 1729
- \faGlobe \ https://www.google.com
- \faEnvelope \ nobody@nowhere.com
to:
- Michael
- Someplace
- with an address
subject: An Update
salutation: My dearest
toname: brother
customdate: 1838-8-9
```

Write the body of the letter in markdown as usual, and generate the PDF by running:

```
pandoc letter.md -o output.pdf --template=template.tex --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

or have a makefile that looks like this:

```
TEX = pandoc
FLAGS = --pdf-engine=xelatex

src1 = template.tex letter.txt
op1 = output

all : $(op1).pdf

$(op1).pdf : $(src1)
	$(TEX) $(filter-out $<,$^ ) -o $@ --template=$< $(FLAGS)
```

For your first use, you would want to update the images for the letterhead and the signature, and optionally customize the fonts to your liking. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/neeldhara/pandoc-letters) to make your own!
