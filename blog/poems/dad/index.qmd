The vendor<br>
at the counter<br>
hands me a stapler,<br>
wondering why<br>
I need yet another.<br>
<br>
Indeed, I didn't,<br>
until I realized<br>
<br>
that she giggles <br>
when I get frantic<br>
about lost pencils,<br>
papers, and staplers<br>
<br>
and she smiles<br>
indignantly<br>
whenever I look,<br>
exasperated,<br>
<br>
at her tiny hands<br>
clutched around <br>
the stuff she found.<br>
<br>
I am just bringing home<br>
another situation<br>
inviting her indignation,<br>
<br>
that eventually<br>
turns into<br>
a bear hug<br>
of pure love.<br>
