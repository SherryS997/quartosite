# {{< bi tools color="darkseagreen" >}} The Three Components of a Refute Question

1. A buggy program/function.
   ```
   def repeated_prefix(a):
    answer = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a):
    if a[i] == a[0]:
      answer += 1
    i += 1
    return answer
    ```
2. The (original) purpose of said program/function.
3. A counterexample.
