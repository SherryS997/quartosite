  title: "The Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method"
  summary: "Zettelkasten is a rather specific note-taking system (disclaimer: it is not something that I use, but I do find the principles vaguely intriguing). It relies heavily on tagging, linking, going with the flow, not overthinking, and somehow simultaneously keeps things systematic from a retrieval perspective. This overview page has a bunch of pointers that that should serve as a roadmap for the Zettelkasten for anyone inclined to find out more."

  title: "Youtube channel: August Bradley"
  summary: "This channel focuses on 'life design' as a broad concept, using Notion as the underlying tool of choice for organization. There is an extensive discussion of the 'PPV' system - Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults. Lots of system thinking in here, and I think although all of it is done on Notion, several principles are tool-agnostic."

  title: "Building a Second Brain"
  summary: "This is a cohort-based course around the notion of building a second brain by Tiago Forte. The material is centered around the 'PARA' method - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives: a fairly intuitive system that many have found useful. Tiago has one published and one upcoming [at the time of this writing] book on these methods. His blog and Youtube channel dive fairly deep into these concepts, and I think the cohorts are useful if you are building something out and are looking for ways to stay accountable on sticking a system, or want a community/platform to brainstorm ideas."
