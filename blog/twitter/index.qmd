I've gotten a lot of well-meaning advice about going out more (e.g, a postdoc abroad, etc.). Turns out, this simply wasn't feasible for me by and large.

With friends who had broader experiences, I had some first-order approximations of what I was missing out on.

For as long as I can remember, I turned to YouTube and podcasts to compensate: for an introvert, being a fly on the wall who didn't have to engage worked out perfectly!

If not actual intel, I felt I caught enough of the vibe of places I couldn't be, so I largely avoided FOMO.

I've never been particularly comfortable on social media, and I can't remember how or when Twitter became an exception. 

So color me amused by this FT column suggesting that the real reason to leave Twitter is that it's... too comfortable?

It has, indeed, been a comfortable hangout for me: and surprisingly so, considering the nastiness it's known for. 

I've taken my chances here and it's largely been very fun, and I daresay my time here has influenced the way I think about many things, for better or worse.

That said, I suppose I do have my own "real reasons" for planning to move on. It's just... not the comfort ðŸ˜€
