## Abstract 


To help students develop a critical eye for human and (increasingly) machine-generated code, this workshop proposes Refute questions. Students are given code created for a stated purpose and asked: Why does the code fail to serve that purpose? Students must provide evidence demonstrating this failure. After a hands-on introduction to Refute questions in their originally proposed context (an alternative to 'Explain in Plain English' questions), participants will receive and review a richer variety of Refute questions for autograded formative and summative assessments, targeting an introductory programming course in Python.

## Abstract 

Mapcode (Viswanath, 2008) is a methodology for iterative algorithmic problem solving in which the requirements and the design of an algorithm are expressed as a collection of maps (total functions).  Once the design is available, it can be easily coded as a program.

The workshop is an introduction to program development using the mapcode methodology.  This will be done through a series of examples which illustrate the mapcode approach to the specification, design and coding of solutions as programs.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}

# {{< bi patch-question-fill color="darkseagreen" >}}  Why should I pay the registration fee for virtual attendance if the lectures will be recorded and available later?

The  main difference is that you will be able to join the lectures over Zoom and have an opportunity interact with the speakers and other participants. You will also be eligible for a certificate subject to participation. 

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}

# {{< bi patch-question-fill color="darkseagreen" >}}  Can I register in one mode now and switch later?

You can register for virtual participation and switch to onsite later by paying the difference in the registration fees. This will be a manual process, please send an email to `neeldhara.m@iitgn.ac.in` with the subject `CSEd workshop registration upgrade` if you are in this situation. However, if you decide to switch from onsite participation to virtual, please note that the difference will _not_ be refunded.

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}

# {{< bi patch-question-fill color="darkseagreen" >}}  Is a refund is avalaible for any valid reason?

The registration fees are **not** refundable in general. We may be able to make exceptions in special cases: please send an email to `neeldhara.m@iitgn.ac.in` with the subject `CSEd workshop registration cancelation` if you have to cancel your participation due to exceptional circumstances.
