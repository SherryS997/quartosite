## Abstract 


To help students develop a critical eye for human and (increasingly) machine-generated code, this workshop proposes Refute questions. Students are given code created for a stated purpose and asked: Why does the code fail to serve that purpose? Students must provide evidence demonstrating this failure. After a hands-on introduction to Refute questions in their originally proposed context (an alternative to 'Explain in Plain English' questions), participants will receive and review a richer variety of Refute questions for autograded formative and summative assessments, targeting an introductory programming course in Python.

## Abstract 

Literate programming (Knuth, 1992) is a style of programming and documentation in which the role of code and comments are reversed. A literate programmer writes a narrative and then embeds code in the narrative. This is akin to supporting a narrative with other artefacts like diagrams or tables. Mapcode (Viswanath, 2008) a methodology for iterative algorithmic problem solving in which the requirement and design of an algorithm is expressed as a collection of maps (total functions). Once the design is available, it can be easily coded as program. Literate programming is a natural framework for expressing the design of the algorithm along with its implementation as a program. The workshop is an introduction to literate program development using the mapcode methodology. This will be done through a series of examples which illustrate the mapcode approach and use the literate programming style to encode the solutions in Python.
