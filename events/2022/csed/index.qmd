## Abstract 


To help students develop a critical eye for human and (increasingly) machine-generated code, this workshop proposes Refute questions. Students are given code created for a stated purpose and asked: Why does the code fail to serve that purpose? Students must provide evidence demonstrating this failure. After a hands-on introduction to Refute questions in their originally proposed context (an alternative to 'Explain in Plain English' questions), participants will receive and review a richer variety of Refute questions for autograded formative and summative assessments, targeting an introductory programming course in Python.

**2:15PM --- 3:45PM.** _Program Development using Literate Programming and Mapcode_ • [Venkatesh Choppella](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~venkatesh.choppella/) <i class="bi bi-info-circle-fill" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Associate Professor at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"></i>

## Abstract 

Literate programming (Knuth, 1992) is a style of programming and documentation in which the role of code and comments are reversed. A literate programmer writes a narrative and then embeds code in the narrative. This is akin to supporting a narrative with other artefacts like diagrams or tables. Mapcode (Viswanath, 2008) a methodology for iterative algorithmic problem solving in which the requirement and design of an algorithm is expressed as a collection of maps (total functions). Once the design is available, it can be easily coded as program. Literate programming is a natural framework for expressing the design of the algorithm along with its implementation as a program. The workshop is an introduction to literate program development using the mapcode methodology. This will be done through a series of examples which illustrate the mapcode approach and use the literate programming style to encode the solutions in Python.

# {{< bi patch-question-fill color="darkseagreen" >}}  Who is the target audience for this workshop?

Anyone with an interest in CS Education at the school and/or college level will find this workshop interesting. We hope to bring together school and college teachers, CS Education researchers, industry professionals, and aspiring educators at any stage of their career --- in particular, students with an interest pedagogy are also welcome.

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}

# {{< bi patch-question-fill color="darkseagreen" >}}  Are there any technical pre-requisites?

There are no explicit pre-requisites, although some experience with teaching introductory programming classes and/or data structures and algorithms would be relevant.

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}

# {{< bi patch-question-fill color="darkseagreen" >}}  Is accommodation available for outstation participants?

If you would like to join us in person and need accommodation, please send an email to `neeldhara.m@iitgn.ac.in` with the subject `Accommodation Request for the CSEd Workshop`. We expect most of the in-person attendance to be local, and encourage others to join us online. However, we are happy to explore accommodation options on request.

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}

# {{< bi patch-question-fill color="darkseagreen" >}}  Why should I pay the registration fee for virtual attendance if the lectures will be recorded and available later?

The  main difference is that you will be able to join the lectures over Zoom and have an opportunity interact with the speakers and other participants. You will also be eligible for a certificate subject to participation. 

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}

# {{< bi patch-question-fill color="darkseagreen" >}}  Can I register in one mode now and switch later?

You can register for virtual participation and switch to onsite later by paying the difference in the registration fees. This will be a manual process, please send an email to `neeldhara.m@iitgn.ac.in` with the subject `CSEd workshop registration upgrade` if you are in this situation. However, if you decide to switch from onsite participation to virtual, please note that the difference will _not_ be refunded.

:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}

# {{< bi patch-question-fill color="darkseagreen" >}}  Is a refund is avalaible for any valid reason?

The registration fees are **not** refundable in general. We may be able to make exceptions in special cases: please send an email to `neeldhara.m@iitgn.ac.in` with the subject `CSEd workshop registration cancelation` if you have to cancel your participation due to exceptional circumstances.
