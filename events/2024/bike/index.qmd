## About the Speaker 

Sridhar Iyer has been a faculty member at IIT Bombay since 1999. Currently he is a Professor in the Educational Technology Programme, while earlier he was with the Dept of Computer Science & Engg.

His current research interests includes: Technology enhanced learning of disciplinary practices, Teacher use of educational technologies, and Computer science education research. Prior to Educational Technology, he has worked in wireless networking protocols and mobile applications.

Sridhar Iyer received the ACM India Outstanding Contrubution to Computing Education Award in 2020, the AECT International Contribution Award in 2019, and Excellence in Teaching Award at IIT Bombay in 2016 and 2013. He is also the President of the EdTech Society in India.

Some development projects that that he has conceptualized and led are: (i) Computer Masti, a series of books for teaching-learning of Computers in schools. These products have seen more than 100K downloads from 120 countries. In 2016, Computer Masti was acquired by a company and the books are now being used in ~1000 schools in India. (ii) Project OSCAR, a repository of ~450 Interactive Visualizations for topics at the school and higher education levels.


Sridhar Iyer received his BTech, MTech and PhD from the Dept of Computer Science & Engg at IIT Bombay. More information is available from [his webpage](www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sri).

**4PM --- 5PM.** _Curriculum Design as an Engineering Problem_ • Shriram Krishnamurthi

:::{.callout-tip icon="false" collapse="true"}

## Abstract 

Around the world, numerous countries are rushing to add computer science to school curricula. Given this sense of urgency, many curricula are being proposed and tried out, often with the goal of teaching “computational thinking”. Due to the lack of widespread expertise in computing education, technologists everywhere — many with a minimal understanding of schools — are being drafted to weigh in on curricula or are even designing their own, in some cases turning these into commercial ventures.
 
In this climate, how should we actually address curriculum design? What are the constraints and affordances in schools, and what does it take for computation to actually be effective in teaching thinking? Given that curricula, once adopted, often stay in place for a long time, the need for research-driven designs is especially pressing.
 
This talk will primarily critique the notion of “computational thinking”. It will also distill lessons from Bootstrap, one of the largest computing outreach programs in the USA. The core principles discussed apply across curricula, countries, and ages.

## About the Speaker 

Shriram is the Vice President for Programming Languages at Brown University in Providence, RI, USA. He’s not, really, but that’s what it says on his business card. At heart, he's a person of ill-repute: a Schemer, Racketeer, and Pyreteer. He believes tropical fruit are superior to all other kinds. He is terrified of success, because he may be forced to buy a suit. He is known to interrogate his audiences to ensure they’re paying attention. So, be alert. You can read email later.
